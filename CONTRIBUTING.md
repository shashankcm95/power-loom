# Contributing — Git Workflow

Going-forward conventions for the claude-toolkit repo. Adopted post-H.2.7 after the user noted that the H.1 → H.2.7 phase work had landed directly on `main` without branching, tagging, or PR review. **All prior phase commits are now retroactively tagged** (`phase-H.1` through `phase-H.2.7`); the conventions below apply to new work.

## Branch model

- `main` — protected. Direct commits only for trivial doc fixes (typos, README link tweaks). Anything substantive goes through a feature branch.
- Feature branches:
  - **Phase work**: `feat/phase-H.x.y-short-name` (e.g., `feat/phase-H.2.8-budget-extensions`)
  - **Bug fixes**: `fix/short-description` (e.g., `fix/verifier-regex-extension-length`)
  - **Refactors**: `refactor/short-description`
  - **Docs**: `docs/short-description`
- One branch per logical change. Don't bundle unrelated fixes — they should be separate branches + separate PRs for separate reviews.

## Commit conventions

Conventional commits, same as before:

```
feat(phase-H.2.8): on-demand budget extensions

[Body — what changed and why]

[Optional footer — Co-Authored-By, BREAKING CHANGE notes]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`.

For phase work, scope is `phase-H.x.y` so commits remain auditable across the H.2 trajectory.

## Tagging policy

- **Phase tags**: every phase that ships gets an annotated tag at the merge commit.
  - Format: `phase-H.x.y` (matches commit scope; e.g., `phase-H.2.8`)
  - Annotated (`-a` flag), with one-line description in the message
  - Apply at the moment the phase's branch merges to main
- **Release tags** (future): `v0.1.0`, `v0.2.0`, etc. Adopt semver once we have a stable surface (~Phase H.3+).

## PR workflow

The remote is `github.com/shashankcm95/claude-skills-consolidated`. Use `gh pr create` for every feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/phase-H.2.8-budget-extensions
# ... do work, commit ...
git push -u origin feat/phase-H.2.8-budget-extensions
gh pr create --title "feat(phase-H.2.8): on-demand budget extensions" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- New scripts/agent-team/budget-tracker.js
- Extension request/approve flow

```

PR review checklist (self-review when working solo):
- [ ] All E2E probes documented in commit message + actually green when re-run
- [ ] No secrets in code (env vars only)
- [ ] Spec docs updated if schema changed (contract-format.md)
- [ ] BACKLOG.md follow-ups added for known limitations
- [ ] SKILL.md phase-status entry reflects what shipped

## Merge policy

- **Squash-and-merge** for small features (1-3 commits on the branch). Keeps main history linear.
- **Merge with `--no-ff`** for substantial features (4+ commits, multiple distinct changes). Preserves the branch story.
- Never `git rebase` shared branches. Never force-push to `main`.

## Tagging at merge

After PR merge, tag the merge commit:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git tag -a phase-H.2.8 -m "Phase H.2.8: on-demand budget extensions"
git push origin phase-H.2.8
```

| `phase-H.6.7` | `60f7991` | Canonical-source registry (23 entries: skill-name → official-docs URL) — L2 of evolution loop |
| `phase-H.6.8` | `6ba5406` | First post-H.6.7 orchestration test — 13-node-backend.kira PASS on rate-limiting task (H.6.1 closed) |
| `phase-H.6.9` | `7e771ce` | Full post-H.6.7 orchestration cycle: 5 tasks / 5 PASS / 5 personas / 5 forged skills / 6 builder verdicts toolkit-wide (H.6.x cycle CLOSED) |

| `phase-H.7.2` | (TBD) | Theory-driven weighted trust score — second phase via corrected pattern; weighted_trust_score now surfaces alongside tierOf (unchanged); 11 builder verdicts toolkit-wide |
| `phase-H.7.3` | (TBD) | Route-decision intelligence — deterministic 7-dimension gate at /build-team Step 0 (stakes/novelty/compound/audit/scope/convergence/user-facing); cuts over-routing on trivial tasks (BACKLOG cleanup root) and preserves under-routing protection on compound-stakes tasks (k8s manifest route, URL shortener borderline). theo-architect designed; noor implemented. **n=20 verdict milestone hit — H.7.4 empirical refit unblocked.** |
| `phase-H.5.7` | (TBD) | Engineering-task contract template (shared generic, mirrors challenger.contract.json shape) + build-team Step 7 task-type heuristic + structural-code-review cross-link — closes M-5 from H.6.9 |
| `phase-CS-6` | (TBD) | End-user USING.md walkthrough — first asymmetric architect+confused-user pair-run; ari hits HIGH-TRUST (first identity ever); HETS-on-git future-improvement BACKLOG entry bundled |
| `phase-H.7.4` | (TBD) | Empirical refit of weighted_trust_score weights from accumulated 70 pattern entries — file_citations_per_finding 0.10→0.135 (r=0.439 moderate); tokens override (normative vs descriptive); WEIGHT_PROFILE_VERSION="h7.4-empirical-v1"; first production firing of H.7.1 high-trust spot-check (A2 skipped for ari) |
| `phase-H.7.5` | `80a7852` | Route-decision context-awareness + forcing-instruction fallback — closes H.7.4 false-negative where bare task scored 0/root because routing signal lived in prior turn. 4 layers: (A) `--context` flag; (B) prompt-enrichment Step 0.5 reads 1-3 prior turns; (C) borderline-promotion rule (mira CRITICAL C-1, load-bearing math fix); (D) `[ROUTE-DECISION-UNCERTAIN]` forcing instruction (mira CRITICAL C-2 narrowed trigger to `low_signal`). No subprocess LLM calls — stays within forcing-instruction-injection pattern. mira architect-only verdict (medium-trust full verification); root applied implementation manually after kira spawn withdrawn. weights_version v1.1-context-aware-2026-05-07. |
| `phase-publish-polish-H.0` | `c189ed3` | Publishing-readiness polish bundle — closes 6 actionable findings from two prior plugin-readiness reviews: (1) plugin.json `$schema` + explicit component paths; (2) entities.json "Severity" anomaly removed; (3) mempalace.yaml keyword dedupe; (4) ATTRIBUTION 8-point → 7-point smoke test claim; (5) .gitignore tracked-file contradiction resolved; (6) install.sh recursive copy for scripts/agent-team/ (closes legacy-installer HETS gap). Doc/config only — no version bump. 7/7 smoke tests pass; 12 HETS scripts copy correctly. Marketplace-ready. |
| `phase-CS-13` | `e767ff8` | IRL test environment isolation (env-var completion) — closes the partial CS-13 BACKLOG item. spawn-recorder.js + pattern-recorder.js now honor `HETS_SPAWN_HISTORY_PATH` + `HETS_PATTERNS_PATH` env overrides (default to `~/.claude/*` for backward compat). Coverage matrix now 4 of 4: `HETS_IDENTITY_STORE` (H.2.4) + `HETS_RUN_STATE_DIR` (H.5.5) + `HETS_SPAWN_HISTORY_PATH` (CS-13) + `HETS_PATTERNS_PATH` (CS-13). IRL user-task tests can now route all state to `~/Documents/claude-toolkit-irl/` without contaminating toolkit-meta trust-formula state. ~30 LoC; 5/5 verification probes pass. |
| `phase-H.4.3` | `dce5ee2` | Prompt-enrich-trigger intent-aware skip — closes user-flagged confirmation-variant gap where "sure, go for it"/"yeah do it"/"let's go with X" leaked past strict SKIP_PATTERNS regex. Layer 1 (regex): 2 new patterns for affirmation+continuation + standalone action-confirmations; capped to confirmation-shape verbs to avoid false-positives on "yes the thing is broken". Layer 2 ([CONFIRMATION-UNCERTAIN] forcing instruction): emitted when ≤5 words + soft signal + strict regex abstained — mirrors [ROUTE-DECISION-UNCERTAIN] (H.7.5). No subprocess LLM. 3 new smoke tests (7 → 10); ATTRIBUTION updated. **Shipped root-direct** — route-decide gate said `root` at score 0.075, correctly preventing over-routing on ~50 LoC pattern-extension. Eighth phase shape: root-direct ship guided by gate. |

`d166add` (README refresh through H.2.4) and `90b87ac` (chat-scan BACKLOG additions) were doc-only commits — no tags (matches "trivial docs allowed direct on main" rule).

## What this changes vs prior practice

| Before (H.1 → H.2.7) | After (H.2.8 onwards) |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| All commits direct to `main` | Feature branches per phase / fix |
| No tags | `phase-H.x.y` tag at every merge |
| Self-merged via single push | PR via `gh pr create` (self-review checklist) |
| No clear release boundary | Each tag is a navigable boundary; `git checkout phase-H.2.4` reproduces that state |

## When to skip the workflow

- **Hotfix on main**: a single-line typo fix in a doc — direct commit + push is fine.
- **Experimental scratch**: spike branches that won't merge — no PR needed, but DO NOT name them `feat/` (use `spike/` or `wip/`).
- **Work-in-progress sync**: pushing to your own feature branch mid-work to back up. No PR until ready for review.

## Post-phase install convention (H.3.3)

The toolkit ships in two locations:

1. The toolkit repo at `~/Documents/claude-toolkit/` (canonical source — what you edit + commit + PR)
2. The installed view at `~/.claude/` (what Claude Code actually loads — slash commands, skills, agents, hooks)

When a phase ships content that affects the user-invocable surface (commands, skills, agents, rule docs, hooks), **the installer must be re-run** to sync the new content into `~/.claude/`. Until that happens, the new commands/skills exist in the repo but are NOT discoverable by Claude Code.

CS-1 confused-user.sam caught this gap concretely: after H.2.5 shipped `commands/build-team.md` + `skills/tech-stack-analyzer/SKILL.md`, **neither was installed** — the user-facing story was undelivered for any installer who hadn't re-run install.sh since H.2.4. H.3.3 fixed this and adopts the convention below.

### Post-phase install convention

Run after every PR merge that touches `commands/`, `skills/`, `agents/`, `rules/`, or `hooks/scripts/`:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/claude-toolkit
./install.sh --diff --commands --skills --agents --rules --hooks  # preview
./install.sh --commands --skills --agents --rules --hooks         # install
```

Restart Claude Code to pick up the changes (or wait for the next session — each session re-loads the available-skills set).

### What's safe to skip

Phases that touch ONLY `scripts/agent-team/`, `swarm/`, or `skills/agent-team/{patterns,kb}/` don't need the installer — those paths aren't synced into `~/.claude/`. The HETS scripts (per the manual-sync convention earlier in this CONTRIBUTING doc) are copied into `~/.claude/scripts/agent-team/` separately, by the per-script `cp` step that each phase commit explicitly runs.

### Periodic reconciliation

Even when no phase ships user-facing content, run `./install.sh --diff --all` quarterly. If anything's drifted, re-install. (A future phase could add this as a CI check or a `chaos-test` pre-flight per CS-1's H.2.x discipline-check section.)
