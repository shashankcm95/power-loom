# Agent Team — Hierarchical Engineering Team Simulation (HETS)

Reusable toolkit primitive for orchestrating multiple agents in a tree structure that mimics a real software engineering team: PM → Senior → Mid → Junior. Each level has scoped responsibilities, contracts that must be satisfied, and budget allocations. Trust builds incrementally so high-trust roles get spot-checked rather than fully reviewed.

## When to use HETS

- Multi-step tasks that decompose naturally into parallel sub-tasks
- Tasks where verification matters (not just output, but approach quality)
- Tasks where you'd benefit from review at multiple abstraction levels
- Audits, code reviews, large refactors, multi-file features

## When NOT to use HETS

- Single-actor tasks (just spawn one Agent directly)
- Tasks under 30 minutes (the orchestration overhead exceeds the work)
- Tasks where a single perspective is correct (no review needed)

## The role hierarchy

| Real-world role | Agent role | Depth | Verifies | Budget |
|----------------|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| Product Manager | super-agent | 0 | Cross-area patterns, business outcome | Uses parent context |
| Senior Engineer | orchestrator | 1 | Architectural soundness of children | 8K tokens |
| Mid Engineer | sub-orchestrator | 2 | Implementation quality of children | 8K tokens |
| Junior Engineer | actor | 2-3 | Functional outputs match contract | 30K tokens |

**Recursion limit**: `max_depth = 3` by default. At depth 3, only actors can be spawned.

## The triple contract (anti-1000-zeros defense)

Each agent has THREE contracts, validated by `scripts/agent-team/contract-verifier.js`:

### 1. Functional contract — did you produce required outputs?
- Output structure (frontmatter, sections)
- Minimum quantities (≥N findings, ≥M citations)
- Required fields populated

### 2. Anti-pattern contract — did you avoid known shortcuts?
- No paraphrasing of prior runs (text similarity check)
- No template repetition across child outputs
- All claims have evidence markers (`file:line`, `verified by`)
- No padding without acknowledgment

### 3. Pattern contract (H.2.7 — shipped) — did you use correct approach?
- **`noUnrolledLoops`**: scans code blocks in actor findings; ≥5 identical lines = fail (catches manual unrolling)
- **`noExcessiveNesting`**: brace-counting depth check on code blocks; default `maxDepth: 4` (C-family only — Python's indentation-based nesting is a documented limitation)
- See [patterns/structural-code-review.md](patterns/structural-code-review.md) for the design + when-to-use guidance

The 1000-zeros example now fails Contract #3 cleanly: the unrolled `print(0)` × 1000 trips `noUnrolledLoops` at the 5th repetition.

## Workflow

### 1. Pre-run: load contracts and budgets
For each agent role you'll spawn, locate its contract file (e.g., `swarm/personas-contracts/01-hacker.contract.json`). The contract specifies:
- Token budget (with extension policy)
- Required functional outputs
- Anti-pattern checks
- Acceptable fallback behaviors

### 2. Spawn with explicit contract
Each spawned agent receives in its prompt:
- Its frontmatter contract (id, role, depth, parent, max_depth)
- Reference to its contract file (`see X.contract.json`)
- Token budget and extension policy
- Required outputs schema

### 3. Track in tree
The `tree-tracker.js` records every spawn:
```bash
node scripts/agent-team/tree-tracker.js spawn \
  --run-id chaos-... --parent super-root \
  --child orch-code --task "..." --role orchestrator
```

This persists to `swarm/run-state/{run_id}/tree.json` with full audit trail (spawn time, parent, status).

### 4. Agent completes → contract verifier runs
After each agent finishes, the parent (or super agent) invokes:

```bash
node scripts/agent-team/contract-verifier.js \
  --contract swarm/personas-contracts/01-hacker.contract.json \
  --output swarm/run-state/{run_id}/node-actor-hacker.md \
  --previous-run swarm/run-state/{prior_run_id}
```

Returns JSON with:
- `verdict`: pass | partial | fail
- Per-check status (functional, anti-pattern)
- Recommendation: accept | retry-with-tighter-prompt | escalate-to-orchestrator

### 5. On failure: retry once with tighter prompt
If verdict is `fail` and the agent has retry budget, the parent re-spawns with:
- A clearer task description
- Specific failed check ids highlighted
- Reduced scope if budget is tight

If retry also fails: escalate to orchestrator. The orchestrator may either accept-with-caveat (mark in their findings) or downgrade the trust score for that persona.

### 6. Self-learning hook
Every contract verification result is appended to `~/.claude/agent-patterns.json` via `pattern-recorder.js`:

```json
{
  "task_signature": "<hash of task>",
  "agent_role": "actor",
  "persona": "01-hacker",
  "verdict": "pass",
  "checks_passed": ["F1", "F2", "F3", "A1", "A3"],
  "checks_failed": ["A2"],
  "evidence_quality": 0.85,
  "tokens_used": 28400,
  "tokens_extended": false,
  "ran_at": "2026-05-02T..."
}
```

This feeds the existing `/self-improve` workflow so users can see WHICH agent patterns succeed across runs and WHICH consistently fail.

### 7. Super agent reviews
After all leaves complete and contracts verify:
- Super agent runs the aggregator at `~/Documents/claude-toolkit/swarm/hierarchical-aggregate.js` (NOT in `scripts/agent-team/` — historical placement; persistent BACKLOG item to relocate or symlink)
- Reviews orchestrator-level synthesis
- Spot-checks actor outputs based on trust scores (Phase H.2)
- Writes consolidated report
- Triggers cross-run delta analysis

## Inheritance from MiroFish (and beyond)

| MiroFish concept | HETS analog |
|------------------|-------------|
| Multi-platform parallel sim | Multi-orchestrator parallel decomp |
| `simulation_manager.py` | `tree-tracker.js` + orchestrator skill |
| `report_agent.py` | `super-agent.md` + `hierarchical-aggregate.js` |
| Static personality | Trust-evolving role contracts |
| Run state tracking | `tree.json` + per-node `node-{id}.md` files |

The HETS pattern goes further than MiroFish in three ways:
1. **Verifiable contracts** — every agent must satisfy functional + anti-pattern checks
2. **Recursion with limit** — orchestrators can spawn sub-orchestrators (bounded by max_depth)
3. **Trust-based delegation** (Phase H.2) — high-trust roles get spot-checked instead of fully reviewed

## Anti-pattern: the 1000-zeros problem

Stated by user: *"a sub-agent is asked to create a program to print a 1000 0s. We'd expect a loop. But, it's just as likely that printing 0 a thousand times could pass the test but is architecturally wrong."*

The defense:
- **Functional contract** would pass either solution (output is 1000 zeros)
- **Anti-pattern contract** detects template repetition (1000 lines of `console.log("0")`)
- **Pattern contract** (H.2) detects missing abstraction (no loop construct found in the code)
- **Trust scoring** (H.2) penalizes patterns that brute-force their way to passing

## Persona-skills mapping (Phase H.2-bridge)

Each persona contract has `skills.required` (must invoke ≥1) and `skills.recommended` (advisory):

```json
"skills": {
  "required": ["security-audit"],
  "recommended": ["review", "research-mode"]
}
```

Spawn prompts list **skill names only** (not descriptions) — the actor invokes the `Skill` tool to load on demand. Saves ~80% prompt-tokens per skill mention. See pattern: [persona-skills-mapping](patterns/persona-skills-mapping.md).

## Agent identity & reputation (Phase H.2-bridge)

Persona = role; identity = named instance. Each persona has a small roster (e.g. architect → `["mira", "theo", "ari"]`); spawns assign one identity at a time and the identity accumulates per-instance trust across runs. So "I trust mira" becomes meaningful, not just "I trust architects."

```bash
node scripts/agent-team/agent-identity.js init      # one-time, creates ~/.claude/agent-identities.json
node scripts/agent-team/agent-identity.js assign --persona 04-architect    # round-robin returns "mira"
node scripts/agent-team/agent-identity.js stats --identity 04-architect.mira
```

Verifier accepts `--identity persona.name` and `--skills s1,s2`; both flow into `agent-patterns.json` (per-persona aggregate) AND `agent-identities.json` (per-identity track record). See pattern: [agent-identity-reputation](patterns/agent-identity-reputation.md).

## Pattern library

Reusable patterns extracted from HETS development live in `patterns/`. Each pattern has a **summary block (≤5 lines, paste-inline cheap)** and a full doc with intent, components, failure modes, validation strategy. See `patterns/README.md` for the index. Current catalog:

| Pattern | Status |
|---------|--------|
| [Asymmetric Challenger](patterns/asymmetric-challenger.md) | implementing (H.2.3) |
| [Trust-Tiered Verification Depth](patterns/trust-tiered-verification.md) | implementing (H.2.4) |
| [Convergence-as-Signal](patterns/convergence-as-signal.md) | observed |
| [Persona-Skills Mapping](patterns/persona-skills-mapping.md) | active (H.2.6 closed the loop) |
| [Agent Identity & Reputation](patterns/agent-identity-reputation.md) | implementing |
| [Meta-Validation](patterns/meta-validation.md) | active |
| [Prompt Distillation](patterns/prompt-distillation.md) | implementing |
| [Shared Knowledge Base](patterns/shared-knowledge-base.md) | implementing |
| [Content-Addressed References](patterns/content-addressed-refs.md) | implementing |
| [Skill Bootstrapping](patterns/skill-bootstrapping.md) | implementing (H.2.5) |
| [Tech-Stack Analyzer](patterns/tech-stack-analyzer.md) | implementing (H.2.5) |
| [Structural Code Review](patterns/structural-code-review.md) | implementing (H.2.7) |

To target a pattern in a future chaos run, read its "Validation Strategy" section — each lists concrete failure modes and how an actor could stress them. `chaos-test --pattern <name>` is planned for full H.2.

## Shared knowledge base (Phase H.2-bridge.2)

`kb/` is the team's shared documentation — one source of truth, content-addressed, snapshot-frozen per run. See [shared-knowledge-base pattern](patterns/shared-knowledge-base.md) and `kb/README.md`.

```bash
# At run start: freeze the manifest into the run-state dir
node scripts/agent-team/kb-resolver.js snapshot ${RUN_ID}

# In spawn prompts: hand actors refs (not inlined content)
# Example skills block: "your KB scope: kb:hets/spawn-conventions@10429c4c"

# Actor's first action: resolve the ref
node scripts/agent-team/kb-resolver.js resolve kb:hets/spawn-conventions@10429c4c
```

Refs of the form `kb:<id>@<short-hash>` validate the doc hasn't drifted since the snapshot. See [content-addressed-refs pattern](patterns/content-addressed-refs.md). Starter KB:
- `kb:hets/spawn-conventions` — the canonical 5-step spawn convention
- `kb:hets/identity-roster` — per-persona identity rosters
- `kb:web-dev/react-essentials` — reference doc for the planned `09-react-frontend` persona

## Files in this skill

- `SKILL.md` — this file
- `contract-format.md` — full spec for contract JSON
- `BACKLOG.md` — deferred work + rationale (added in H.2.1)
- `patterns/` — reusable architectural patterns (substrate for new simulations)
- `kb/` — shared knowledge base (content-addressed, frozen-per-run)
- `role-templates/pm.md` — super-agent role template
- `role-templates/senior.md` — orchestrator role template
- `role-templates/engineer.md` — actor role template

## Files this skill consumes (in scripts/agent-team/)

- `tree-tracker.js` — BFS/DFS over the spawn tree, persisted to tree.json
- `contract-verifier.js` — runs functional + anti-pattern checks (post-fix: prototype-pollution-safe, .every semantics, valid JS regex for end-of-input)
- `pattern-recorder.js` — appends results to ~/.claude/agent-patterns.json; forwards `--identity` to agent-identity.js when supplied
- `agent-identity.js` — assign/list/stats/record per-identity; round-robin assignment with file-locked persistence to ~/.claude/agent-identities.json
- `kb-resolver.js` — content-addressed KB resolver (cat / hash / list / resolve / scan / snapshot / register)
- `budget-tracker.js` (H.2.8) — per-spawn token-usage tracking + on-demand budget extensions; reads contract `budget.{tokens, extensible, maxExtensions, extensionAmount}` and enforces them. Closes the architect's "budget enforcement is fictional" finding from chaos-20260502-060039. Per-run state in `swarm/run-state/<run-id>/budgets.json`.
- `pattern-runner.js` (H.2.9) — extracts testable scenarios from pattern docs' `## Validation Strategy` section; emits actor-prompt skeletons for `chaos-test --pattern <name>` flow. Subcommands: `list-patterns`, `extract`, `summary`, `prompts`.
- `contracts-validate.js` (H.3.0) — cross-validates 4 sources of truth (per-pattern frontmatter ↔ patterns/README.md ↔ SKILL.md catalog ↔ contract `skill_status` filesystem references). 7 validators: pattern-status-frontmatter, pattern-status-readme-consistency, pattern-status-skill-md-consistency, pattern-related-bidirectional, contract-skills-status-keys, contract-skill-status-values, contract-kb-scope-resolves. Closes architect's #1 top-leverage change from chaos-20260502-060039. CS-1 first run surfaced 29 real drift violations; backlog item per validator.
- (Phase H.2: `trust-tracker.js` — persists per-persona trust scores; superseded by `agent-identity.js`'s tier API in H.2.4)

## Phase status

- **H.1 (shipped)**: tree tracking, functional + anti-pattern contracts, self-learning recorder
- **H.2-bridge (this phase)**: verifier-bug fixes (C-1 prototype pollution, H-1 `.some` semantics, `\Z` regex), persona-skills mapping in contracts, identity registry + per-identity recording, patterns library
- **H.2-bridge.2 (shipped)**: shared knowledge base + content-addressed refs (`kb-resolver.js`), 4 new pattern docs (shared-KB, content-addressed-refs, skill-bootstrapping, tech-stack-analyzer), 3 starter KB docs
- **H.2.1 (shipped — vertical slice)**: first builder persona end-to-end. `06-ios-developer` persona + contract with promise-mode skill_status; `swift-development` specialist skill; `kb:mobile-dev/{swift-essentials,ios-app-architecture}` KB docs; identity roster `[riley, morgan, taylor]`. **Bonus fixes bundled**: tree-tracker path resolution (env var override), tree-tracker H-2 cycle guard, tree-tracker M-2 collision warning, verifier `[a-z]{1,4}` → `[a-z]{1,10}` regex (was rejecting `.swift`/`.kotlin`/`.python` — surfaced by the vertical slice itself).
- **H.2.2 (shipped — builder family complete)**: 6 more builder personas: `07-java-backend`, `08-ml-engineer`, `09-react-frontend`, `10-devops-sre`, `11-data-engineer`, `12-security-engineer`. Each with persona + contract + identity roster. 11 starter KB docs across 6 new domains (`backend-dev/`, `ml-dev/`, `web-dev/typescript-react-patterns`, `infra-dev/`, `data-dev/`, `security-dev/`). **Marketplace integration bonus**: contracts reference `knowledge-work-plugins` skills (e.g., `engineering:incident-response`, `data:sql-queries`, `design:accessibility-review`) via new `marketplace:<plugin>` status value alongside `available` and `not-yet-authored`. Spec documented in `contract-format.md`. E2E validated: 6 identities assignable, sample contract verifier pass with marketplace-namespaced skill invocations recorded.
- **H.2.3 (shipped — asymmetric challenger)**: shared `challenger.contract.json` template (~10K token budget, F3=`noEmptyChallengeSection`, A1=`noPaddingPhrases` with stricter list catching capitulation drift). New `agent-identity assign-challenger --exclude-persona X` subcommand prefers different-persona pick (falls back to same-persona-different-identity if no different-persona available). New `kb:hets/challenger-conventions` doc (5-step spawn flow + output format + failure modes). Pattern doc status `proposed → implementing`. E2E validated 4 probes: assign-challenger picks different persona (probe 1+2), GOOD challenger output verifies pass (probe 3), EMPTY challenger fails on F3 (no challenges) AND A1 (padding phrase) — both defenses fire as designed.
- **H.2.4 (shipped — trust-tiered verification, LATENCY-CRITICAL)**: queryable tier API in `agent-identity.js` (`tier --identity X`, `recommend-verification --identity X`); verification policy table (high-trust → spot-check + skip `noTextSimilarityToPriorRun`; medium-trust → asymmetric challenger; low-trust + unproven → symmetric pair). New `--skip-checks <ids-or-names>` flag on `contract-verifier.js` skips listed checks with `status: 'skipped'` audit trail. New `kb:hets/symmetric-pair-conventions` doc. Pattern doc status `proposed → implementing`. New `HETS_IDENTITY_STORE` env var lets ephemeral runs use temp registries (used by E2E fixtures). E2E validated 4 probes against seeded fixture covering all 4 tier levels: tier formula correct; recommend-verification policy correct; --skip-checks works by check.id and by check.check name.
- **H.2.5 (shipped — tech-stack analyzer + skill-bootstrapping wiring)**: new top-level skill `skills/tech-stack-analyzer/SKILL.md` (orchestrator-side entry point for "build me X" tasks; 7-step workflow with 2 user-gates). New `kb:hets/stack-skill-map` (12 stack entries mapping web / mobile / backend / data / ml / infra / security domains → required + recommended skills + suggested personas + rationale). New `/build-team` command as user-facing entry point. Patterns `tech-stack-analyzer` + `skill-bootstrapping` status `proposed → implementing`. E2E validated 6 probes: stack-skill-map resolves via `cat` and via hash-pinned ref; skill scaffold present + correct trigger sections; command exists; cross-validation confirms 7 stack-skill-map skill names map to real persona contracts AND 4 marketplace skills exist on disk in `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/knowledge-work-plugins/`.
- **H.2.6 (shipped — invokesRequiredSkills verifier check)**: new functional check that reads the actor's transcript JSONL (`--transcript <path>`) and verifies each `skills.required` was invoked via the `Skill` tool. Falls back to `--skills` CLI flag when no transcript supplied; graceful pass with `reason: 'no_skills_source_supplied'` when neither. Skips skills with `skill_status: 'not-yet-authored'` (promise mode). Functional-check dispatcher extended to support rich `{pass, ...meta}` returns alongside boolean returns (mirrors antiPattern shape). `persona-skills-mapping` pattern status `implementing → active` (now has enforcement teeth). E2E validated 5 probes: transcript-with-required PASS; transcript-empty FAIL on missing skills (promise-mode skipped correctly); --skills fallback PASS; no-source-graceful PASS with reason; missing-transcript-file FAIL with reason.
- **H.2.7 (shipped — full pattern contracts, third-leg of triple defense)**: closes the long-standing DOCUMENTATION-DEBT flag where SKILL.md described "triple contract" but only 2/3 were implemented. New functional checks: `noUnrolledLoops` (scans code blocks for ≥N identical lines = manual unrolling) + `noExcessiveNesting` (brace-counting depth on C-family code blocks; default `maxDepth: 4`, matches CLAUDE.md fundamentals; strips string literals + comments before counting). New pattern doc `patterns/structural-code-review.md`. The 1000-zeros example now trips `noUnrolledLoops` at the 5th repetition — closes the long-running anti-pattern oversell. E2E validated 5 probes covering unrolled-loop detection, excessive-nesting detection, clean-code passes, Python-indentation limitation (documented), and code-block extraction.
- **H.2.8 (shipped — on-demand budget extensions)**: closes the architect's "budget enforcement is fictional" finding from chaos-20260502-060039. New `scripts/agent-team/budget-tracker.js` with 5 subcommands: `init`, `record` (manual), `record-from-transcript` (auto-extracts `usage.input_tokens` / `output_tokens` / `cache_creation_input_tokens` / `cache_read_input_tokens` from JSONL), `extend` (returns approve/deny based on contract policy), `status` (run + per-identity views). Per-run state in `swarm/run-state/<run-id>/budgets.json` (gitignored). Reads contract budget fields (`tokens`, `extensible`, `maxExtensions`, `extensionAmount`) — same fields previously documentation-only. E2E validated 7 probes: init creates file; manual record updates totals + reports remaining; transcript extraction sums all usage subcategories correctly; extend approve increments + extends allowance; extend deny when exhausted; run-level status aggregates across spawns; per-identity status surfaces utilization%. **First phase using the new git workflow** — branched on `feat/phase-H.2.8-budget-extensions`, PR merged to main.
- **H.2.9 (shipped — pattern-targeted chaos test runner)**: new `scripts/agent-team/pattern-runner.js` with 4 subcommands (`list-patterns`, `extract`, `summary`, `prompts`). Reads each pattern doc's `## Validation Strategy` section, extracts bullets as testable scenarios, emits ready-to-paste actor-prompt skeletons. Case-insensitive header match (caught a real bug: `structural-code-review.md` uses lowercase "strategy" — initially extracted 0 scenarios, now extracts 5). `chaos-test` command updated with `--pattern <name>` workflow. Total scenarios across the 12 patterns: 49. **All H.2 items now shipped**.
- **CS-1 meta-validation chaos run (chaos-20260502-115628-cs1-meta)**: 5 auditor personas independently surfaced 54 findings across H.2.x. Diagnosis: "substrate-rich but call-site-poor". 4 CRITICAL bugs (kb-resolver path traversal, budget-tracker concurrency loses 32% tokens, `--skip-checks` defeats trust enforcement, `unknown_check` still passes for required checks). Re-opens triple-contract oversell (H.2.7 shipped checks, ZERO contracts opt in). Resolution score on 5 prior architect findings: 5/20 (25%). Step-function improvement: git workflow adoption 0% → 100% post-CONTRIBUTING.md. Process meta-finding: background-spawn execution didn't survive a session-boundary; 3 of 5 actors had to be re-spawned in foreground.
- **H.3.0 (shipped — contracts-validate.js, the single highest-leverage closure per CS-1 super-root)**: pulled from BACKLOG since chaos-20260502-060039 (and re-flagged by CS-1 architect as still unshipped). 7 validators that cross-check the 4 sources of truth that drift independently. First production run surfaced 29 real drift violations confirming CS-1 architect findings (4 pattern-status-readme drifts, 10 pattern-related asymmetric links, 14 contract-skills-status missing entries in auditor contracts, 1 available-but-missing skill file). Validator is read-only — finding fixes is the next phase. Lint-time drift detection now possible.
- **H.3.1 (shipped — quick-wins bundle)**: 5 fixes closing 4 BACKLOG items + 1 CS-1 architect HIGH. (a) `mustNotSkip` flag on contract checks: `--skip-checks` now refuses to skip checks marked mustNotSkip (closes CS-1 hacker.zoe CRIT-2 "trust enforcement bypassable"). (b) `unknown_check` on required functional check now fails the verdict (closes CS-1 hacker.zoe CRIT-1 + BACKLOG.md item from H.2-bridge). (c) `max_depth` enforcement in `tree-tracker.js spawn` — refuses to spawn beyond depth (default 3); closes the architect's "ZERO progress in 9 sub-phases" finding. (d) `hierarchical-aggregate.js` path resolution standardized to env-var override + canonical fallback (matches H.2.1 tree-tracker fix). (e) `cmdSpawn` self-cycle guard (`--child === --parent` rejected; closes CS-1 code-reviewer C-2). E2E validated 5 probes.
- **H.3.2 (shipped — shared `_lib/lock.js` + path traversal fix)**: extracted shared `withLock` primitive to `scripts/agent-team/_lib/lock.js` (unifies prior inline copies in `agent-identity.js` + `pattern-recorder.js`); applied to 3 more RMW scripts (`kb-resolver register`, `budget-tracker record`, `tree-tracker save`). Stale-lock recovery via PID liveness check. Closes CS-1 hacker.zoe CRIT-4 (budget-tracker concurrency loses 32% tokens) + code-reviewer X-3 (tree-tracker race) via the lock library. **Own-validation probe 3 caught a fresh bug in the H.3.2 fix itself**: first version wrapped only `writeBudgetsAtomic` in withLock (still 23% loss), since concurrent loaders read pre-modification state then serialize their writes. Fix: lock the whole RMW at the callsite (`cmdRecord` wraps load+modify+write in `withBudgetLock`); 0% loss. Also: `kb-resolver` path-traversal fix via `path.resolve` boundary check (closes CS-1 hacker.zoe CRIT-3 + code-reviewer H-4 — `kb-resolver cat ../../etc/secrets` no longer reads outside KB_BASE).
- **H.3.3 (shipped — install.sh sync + post-phase install convention)**: re-ran `install.sh` to bring `~/.claude/scripts/agent-team/` to parity with the toolkit canonical copy after H.2.x → H.3.2 drift. Added "sync after every phase" step to CONTRIBUTING.md.
- **H.3.4 (shipped — structural checks opt-in across 7 builder contracts)**: opted contracts 06–12 (iOS, Java, ML, React, DevOps, data, security) into `noUnrolledLoops` (maxRepetitions: 5) + `noExcessiveNesting` (maxDepth: 4). Closes the H.2.7 oversell (shipped checks but ZERO contracts opted in) flagged by CS-1.
- **H.3.5 (shipped — fix all 29 contracts-validate violations)**: resolved every drift finding from H.3.0's first run. 4 pattern-status README mismatches, 10 asymmetric `Related` links, 14 missing `contract-skills-status` entries in auditor contracts (01-05), 1 missing skill file. `node scripts/agent-team/contracts-validate.js` now reports 0 violations across all 7 validators. Lint-time drift detection achieves green-baseline state.
- **CS-2 second meta-validation chaos run (chaos-20260503-154327-cs2)**: re-ran 5 auditors against H.3.0–H.3.5. Surfaced 5 regressions: (1) `_lib/lock.js:37-40` self-PID deadlock (lock holder's prior incarnation crashed leaves same-PID orphan; existing `pid !== process.pid` check skips cleanup); (2) `tree-tracker.js` H.3.2 fix wrapped only the WRITE in withLock — same RMW-race pattern that own-validation probe 3 explicitly proved fatal in budget-tracker; not back-applied to tree-tracker; (3) `contract-verifier.js:388-391` antiPattern dispatch path silently passes `unknown_check` — H.3.1's symmetric fix to the FUNCTIONAL path was not mirrored; (4) `kb-resolver.js` H.3.2 boundary check is lexical-only — symlinks inside KB_BASE pointing outside still escape; (5) `contracts-validate.js --list-validators` always emits JSON regardless of mode (no human-mode parity). Architect resolution score: 12/20 (60%) — meaningful progress over CS-1's 5/20, unmoved items concentrate at orchestration/runtime/single-source-of-truth layer (e.g., `kb_scope` still unconsumed). Process win: post-CONTRIBUTING.md git workflow held 100% (6/6 H.3.x phases through PR flow with annotated tags, zero direct-to-main).
- **H.3.6 (shipped — CS-2 regression fixes)**: bundle of 5 fixes for the regressions above. (1) `_lib/lock.js`: self-PID orphan now reclaimed (treat as stale; `pid === process.pid` is impossible mid-`withLock` so it must be a prior-incarnation orphan); also handles garbage-PID via NaN guard. (2) `tree-tracker.js`: `cmdSpawn` + `cmdComplete` wrap their entire load→modify→save cycle in `withTreeLock` (mirrors budget-tracker `cmdRecord` pattern); 15s timeout for chaos-test contention. `save()` split into plain `writeTreeAtomic` (no lock) + `withTreeLock` helper. (3) `contract-verifier.js`: antiPattern `unknown_check` dispatch now increments failures (`severity === 'fail'` → `antiPatternFailures`; else → `antiPatternWarns`) — symmetric with H.3.1 functional path. (4) `kb-resolver.js`: lexical check kept as cheap first-pass (catches `..`-traversal on missing files); added `fs.realpathSync` second-pass that canonicalizes both candidate + KB_BASE then re-checks boundary — symlinks pointing outside refused. (5) `contracts-validate.js --list-validators`: respects `--json` flag (default human-readable; emits `Available validators (N): ...` listing). E2E validated all 5 probes + kb-resolver legit-read regression check passed. **Pattern observed across H.3.x cycle**: own-validation routinely catches fix-class-not-instance bugs (the bug your fix shipped with). Codify "fix-class-not-instance — when fixing a known anti-pattern, grep sibling files for the same shape" — H.3.6 itself was triggered by CS-2 catching that H.3.2's RMW-race fix wasn't back-applied to tree-tracker.
