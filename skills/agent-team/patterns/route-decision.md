## Summary

Pure-function CLI scores a task on 7 weighted dimensions (stakes, novelty, compound, audit, scope, convergence-value, user-facing) plus an infra-implicit lift and counter-signal penalty. Two thresholds: route ≥0.60, root ≤0.30, borderline between. Defaults to root for trivial work and route for compound architecture-stakes work; borderline cases surface to the user. Sums to ~1.0 at the cap; deterministic, <100ms, theory-driven (refit at n≥20 verdicts).

## Intent

The toolkit had no first-class gate between "user types a task" and "spawn a HETS team" before H.7.3 — root made that call ad-hoc. The dataset of two motivating events: the URL-shortener pair-run cost ~93K tokens for a one-shot user task whose root-direct alternative would have shipped at ~3K (`swarm/run-state/orch-user-task-url-shortener-20260507-062607/`); the BACKLOG-cleanup got architect+code-reviewer for a 9-line doc surgery (`swarm/H.5.7-findings.md:14-16`). At ~30× cost ratio for ~3× failure-mode coverage, the under-/over-routing tax was large enough to deserve a deterministic gate.

The asymmetric cost-quality table (mirrors `missing-capability-signal.md:22-27`):

| Routing | Token cost | Quality on right call | Quality on wrong call |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Root direct, task warrants routing | low (~3K) | 1× failure-mode coverage | misses HIGH issues (e.g., URL-shortener PII + Mermaid drift) |
| Root direct, task is genuinely root-fit | low (~3K) | full coverage | none — correct call |
| HETS routing, task warrants routing | high (~30-100K) | 3× failure-mode coverage | none — correct call |
| **HETS routing, task is genuinely root-fit** | **high (~30-100K)** | **0 marginal coverage** | **30× cost waste** (BACKLOG-cleanup case) |

The route-decision gate exists to minimize the bottom-row case while preserving the third-row case.

## Components

The 7-dimension scoring table consumed by `scripts/agent-team/route-decide.js`:

| Dimension | Weight | Trigger | Example keywords |
|-----------|--------|---------|------------------|
| Stakes | 0.25 | High-stakes context | production, scalable, secure, auth, payments, encryption, oauth, kubernetes, k8s, terraform, helm (24 keywords) |
| Domain novelty | 0.15 | Unfamiliar territory | novel, prototype, experiment, unfamiliar, new framework, ... |
| Compound-strong | 0.15 | Compound design with non-double-counted keyword | schema, migration, protocol, consensus, state-machine, pipeline |
| Compound-weak | 0.075 (suppressed if Stakes fires) | Generic design language alone | architecture, design, framework, system |
| Audit binary | 0.20 (binary) | Audit/compliance task | audit, compliance, certification, regulatory |
| Scope size | 0.075 | Multi-file / multi-component | multi-file, manifest, service, endpoints, apis, ... |
| Convergence value | 0.15 | Non-obvious tradeoffs | tradeoff, options, compare, eviction policy, consistency model, pagination, search, URL shortener |
| User-facing / UX | 0.10 | UX or doc-heavy work | user-facing, walkthrough, tutorial, component, UI, UX, accessibility |
| Infra-implicit-stakes | +0.30 (lift) | Infra prompt | k8s, kubernetes, terraform, helm, docker-compose, ansible, infrastructure, deployment, manifest |
| Counter-signals | -0.25 (single penalty) | Trivial / small | typo, prune, cleanup, delete entries, stale, quick, hello world |
| Short-prompt penalty | -0.10 | <5 words | (no keywords; word-count gate) |

Thresholds: ≥0.60 → route, ≤0.30 → root, between → borderline. Confidence = distance from nearest threshold normalized to [0, 1] over a 0.30 band.

## Failure Modes

1. **Keyword evasion** — task description avoids the keyword set deliberately ("audit my code without saying 'audit'"). Counter: borderline band catches genuine cases via convergence-value + scope-size; users can `--force-route`.
2. **Implicit-stakes miss** — task is high-stakes but doesn't surface keywords (e.g., "make my login flow async"). Partial counter via infra-implicit lift; otherwise relies on user invoking `--force-route`. Future H.7.5+ phase: add domain-classifier (text classifier or LLM tier-2 fallback for borderline) but H.7.3 keeps it pure-function.
3. **Calibration drift** — keyword sets become stale as user's task vocabulary evolves. Counter: `weights_version` in output enables retrospective refit at n≥20 routing decisions per H.7.5+.
4. **Borderline overuse** — too many tasks land in borderline, defeating the gate's purpose (just push everything to user). Counter: monitor borderline-frac; if >40% of decisions are borderline, threshold band needs tightening.
5. **Pure-keyword ceiling** — tasks #2 and #5 in the calibration self-test (React component, USING.md walkthrough) hit zero or near-zero positive dimensions despite the user expecting `route`. This is a structural limitation of pure-keyword routing: subjective "I want a team on this" can't be reproduced from text features alone. `--force-route` is the user's escape hatch; future LLM-tier-2 fallback for low-confidence borderline cases is the proposed follow-up.
6. **Per-user calibration** — a heavy security-engineer might want different weights than a heavy frontend-engineer. Counter: `weights_version` ships in output; future `HETS_WEIGHT_PROFILE` env override would let per-user tuning via JSON config (deferred to H.7.4+).

## Validation Strategy

Self-test calibration: 6 historical tasks should produce specific recommendations.

| # | Task | Expected | Notes |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | "Add rate limiting to my Express API endpoints" | borderline | Stakes (rate-limit) + scope (endpoints) → 0.325 — genuinely borderline (root could implement; HETS shines if multi-tier). |
| 2 | "React search-results-with-pagination component" | root | 0.15 — known limit (R2): pure-keyword routing can't capture "complex UI state" subjectivity. `--force-route` is the user's escape. |
| 3 | "Author k8s Deployment + Service manifest" | route | Stakes (k8s) + scope (manifest, service) + infra-implicit-lift → 0.625. Infra is universally Stakes-bearing. |
| 4 | "Drop 9 stale entries from BACKLOG.md" | root | Counter-signal (stale) → 0. Trivial doc surgery. |
| 5 | "Author USING.md walkthrough" | root | 0 (with short-prompt penalty). Known limit (R2): doc-walkthrough is borderline-subjective. |
| 6 | "Design scalable URL shortener" | borderline | Stakes (scalable) + convergence (URL shortener) → 0.4. Canonical borderline case the gate exists for. |

All 6 land at expected verdicts under the v1 weights (`v1-theory-driven-2026-05-07`).

Stress tests: empty prompt → exit 2; single-keyword prompt → root; multi-keyword high-stakes prompt → route at high confidence; counter-signal + stakes prompt → counter-signal wins (BACKLOG-class).

## When to Use

- Always-on at `/build-team` Step 0 (the literal callsite — see `commands/build-team.md` Step 0)
- Soft rule for ad-hoc tasks via `rules/core/workflow.md`'s "Route-Decision for Non-Trivial Tasks" section
- Any time root is unsure whether a task warrants HETS routing — running the script is cheap (<100ms, deterministic) and the decomposition is itself a useful explanation

## When Not to Use

- User explicitly invokes `--force-route` (e.g., "I know this is borderline but I want a pair-run anyway")
- User explicitly says "just answer this in chat" or asks for a quick / single-line response
- `/chaos-test` runs (which are pre-routed by definition — chaos tests the toolkit, not user tasks)
- Continuation of in-progress orchestration (the gate was already run at task entry)

## Enforcement callsite

The 7-dimension scoring at `scripts/agent-team/route-decide.js` is consumed by `commands/build-team.md` Step 0. Step 0 branches on the `recommendation` field returned by `route-decide.js --task X`, dispatching to one of three flows: `route` (continue to Step 1), `borderline` (escalate to user with score decomposition + 3-option menu), `root` (exit 0 with skip-orchestration message). The Step 0 bash flow uses fail-open default (missing script → assume `route`) to preserve pre-H.7.3 behavior on degraded installs. See `commands/build-team.md` Step 0 for the literal shell flow.

## Related Patterns

- [Tech-Stack Analyzer](tech-stack-analyzer.md) — what fires AFTER the route gate when the recommendation is `route`. The route gate prevents tech-stack-analyzer from running on tasks that don't warrant HETS routing.
- [Trust-Tiered Verification](trust-tiered-verification.md) — same architectural shape: pure-function pre-flight gate that scales depth (or routing) by signal. Both ship substrate + callsite in the same phase.
- [Prompt Distillation](prompt-distillation.md) — the route-decision pattern is itself prompt distillation applied to "should we run the full orchestration?" — turns a high-cost decision into a low-cost score.
