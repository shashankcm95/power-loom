## Summary

**Principle (Hard Parts)**: "Everything in software architecture is a trade-off." Every recommendation must state what is SACRIFICED, not just what is gained.
**Discipline**: surface trade-offs explicitly (consistency vs availability, simplicity vs flexibility) rather than implicitly.
**Test**: when proposing X, can you state what's sacrificed under what context the trade is favorable, and unfavorable?
**Sources**: Hard Parts (entire book + ch 1 + 15) + Fundamentals of Software Architecture + Pragmatic Programmer + PoSD ch 11 + DDIA ch 1.
**Substrate**: H.7.22 Principle Audit IS this enforced; Convention G failure-modes; drift-notes as captured trade-offs.

## Quick Reference

**Principle**: Architecture is about managing trade-offs, not finding perfect solutions. Every major recommendation must articulate what is sacrificed.

**The trade-off vocabulary**:

| Trade-off | Source / Examples |
|-----------|------------------|
| Reliability vs Scalability vs Maintainability | DDIA ch 1 |
| Consistency vs Availability (CAP) | DDIA ch 9 |
| Coupling vs Cohesion | Hard Parts ch 7 |
| Synchronous vs Asynchronous | Hard Parts ch 2 |
| Atomic vs Eventual Consistency | DDIA ch 5 / Hard Parts ch 12 |
| Orchestration vs Choreography | Hard Parts ch 11 |
| Strict vs Loose Contracts | Hard Parts ch 13 |
| Simplicity vs Flexibility (YAGNI vs Speculative Generality) | Pragmatic Programmer |

**Six patterns for articulation**:

1. **The "What's Sacrificed" Question** — articulate gain, sacrifice, favorable context, unfavorable context
2. **The Trade-off Matrix** — rows = options; columns = quality attributes; cells = scores
3. **Design It Twice** (Ousterhout PoSD ch 11) — design 2+ alternatives; compare on simplicity, generality, efficiency, sacrifice
4. **ADR (Architecture Decision Record)** — context / decision / consequences / alternatives / status
5. **Hostile Architect Workflow** — another role argues against the design; surfaces unstated trade-offs
6. **Fitness Functions** — automated checks that an architectural quality is preserved

**Top smells**:

- "Always" / "never" recommendations (no context — articulation absent)
- "Best practices" without "for what context"
- Missing the sacrifice (proposal lists only benefits)
- Strict-domination claims ("X is strictly better than Y")

**Tensions**:

- **Speed of decision**: scope articulation to decision impact; trivial decisions need none
- **YAGNI**: articulation doesn't require building; document decisions even if not flexible
- **Authority**: even when senior architect's call is right, articulation documents reasoning for future similar decisions

**Apply when**: significant architectural decisions; comparing alternatives; team disagreements (surface underlying trade-off); retrospectives.

**Substrate examples**:

- H.7.22 Principle Audit requirement: architect ADRs MUST include explicit trade-off articulation; plan-schema validator enforces structurally
- Convention G failure modes (H.7.25): articulates what's sacrificed if you violate the convention
- 11 → 9 → 8 active marker count (H.7.26-H.7.27): each retirement was an articulated trade-off (performative-differentiation vs unified-marker; redundant-emission vs single-layer; forcing-instruction-shape vs lint-pipeline)
- Drift-notes as captured-trade-offs convention: 60+ drift-notes through H.7.27 each capture an observed trade-off
- Pre-Approval Verification 4-for-4 success: parallel architect + code-reviewer spawn surfaces trade-offs the architect missed
- Soak period as time-bounded trade-off: gain (stability validation) vs sacrifice (deferred features); explicit time-bound prevents compounding

## Intent

Most architectural mistakes aren't from picking the wrong option — they're from not realizing there *was* a trade-off. A team adopts microservices because "they're more scalable" without acknowledging the operational complexity sacrifice. A team chooses synchronous over asynchronous because "it's simpler" without acknowledging the availability sacrifice. A team picks strong consistency because "it's safer" without acknowledging the latency sacrifice.

The fix isn't picking better options — it's making the trade-off **explicit**. Once stated, the team can decide whether the sacrifice is acceptable for their context. Implicit trade-offs become invisible costs; explicit trade-offs become design decisions.

The intent of this principle is to convert "feels right" into "earns itself in this context for these reasons" — a discipline that compounds across decisions, building a system where every choice has a defensible articulation.

## The Principle

> "Everything in software architecture is a trade-off." — *Software Architecture: The Hard Parts* ch 1 (Ford / Richards / Sadalage / Dehghani)

Reformulated:

- **Every architectural decision sacrifices something** — no choice is universally better; choices depend on context
- **Articulation is the discipline** — state the sacrifice explicitly when proposing a recommendation
- **Generic solutions are suspect** — "best practice" without context-specific justification is a smell
- **Trade-off literacy is multi-dimensional** — reliability vs scalability; consistency vs availability; simplicity vs flexibility; maintainability vs velocity; etc.

The Hard Parts' contribution is providing a **vocabulary** for trade-off discussion: Architecture Quantum, Static vs Dynamic Coupling, Granularity Disintegrators vs Integrators, Reuse-via-Abstraction trade-offs, the 7 Saga types, etc. Each named pattern surfaces specific trade-off dimensions that would otherwise stay implicit.

## The trade-off vocabulary

### Reliability vs Scalability vs Maintainability (DDIA ch 1)

Kleppmann's framing: a system has these three concerns, and they often pull in different directions:

- **Reliability**: continues working in face of faults
- **Scalability**: handles growth in load
- **Maintainability**: different people can productively work on it

A system optimized purely for reliability (e.g., synchronous replication everywhere, no eventual consistency) sacrifices scalability (latency, throughput). A system optimized purely for scalability (e.g., aggressive denormalization, async everything) sacrifices maintainability (developer cognitive load, debugging difficulty). Articulating which pulls dominate in your context is the trade-off discipline.

### Consistency vs Availability (CAP)

The classical distributed-systems trade-off (Brewer's CAP theorem):

- **Strong consistency**: all reads see the latest write
- **Availability**: every request gets a response (even if stale)
- **Partition tolerance**: continues operating during network partitions

In a partition, you must choose: refuse the request (CP) or serve stale data (AP). DDIA ch 9 covers the nuances; the choice depends on the application's tolerance for staleness vs unavailability.

For the substrate: kb-resolver chose CP for content-addressed refs (hash mismatch raises rather than returning stale content); fact-force-gate chose AP for tracker file (read attempts succeed even if tracker is mid-update — atomicity guarantees consistency on rename, but reads see the prior state until rename completes).

### Coupling vs Cohesion

A classical trade-off in module design:

- **High cohesion**: a module's parts are strongly related (good)
- **Low coupling**: modules don't depend on each other much (good)

But cohesion and coupling pull in opposite directions: maximally cohesive modules tend to be tightly coupled internally; minimally coupled systems often have low-cohesion modules (because cross-cutting concerns get factored out into utility classes that knit everything together).

Hard Parts ch 7 articulates granularity decisions in these terms: granularity disintegrators (reasons to split) vs granularity integrators (reasons to consolidate). Each split decision sacrifices either internal cohesion or external coupling.

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous Coupling

Hard Parts' "Dynamic Coupling Dimensions":

- **Synchronous**: caller waits for response; tighter coupling, simpler reasoning, but lower availability under failure
- **Asynchronous**: caller fires-and-forgets (or polls); higher availability, but harder error handling, eventual consistency

A system that's async-everywhere has higher operational complexity but better availability under partial failure. A system that's sync-everywhere is easier to reason about but cascade-failures during partial outages.

### Atomic vs Eventual Consistency

Per Hard Parts:

- **Atomic**: all-or-nothing transactions; impossible across distributed boundaries without expensive coordination
- **Eventual**: writes propagate over time; read may return stale; conflict resolution required

The Outbox pattern (DDIA ch 11) is a specific articulation: trade strong consistency for the operational benefit of decoupled publishers + at-least-once delivery + eventual consistency.

### Orchestration vs Choreography

For multi-service workflows:

- **Orchestration**: a coordinator owns workflow state; clear flow; single point of failure; tighter coupling
- **Choreography**: services react to events; resilient to coordinator failure; harder to reason about end-to-end flow

Hard Parts ch 11 catalogs this trade-off in the 7 Saga types. The "best" saga depends on which axis you're optimizing.

### Strict vs Loose Contracts

Per Hard Parts ch 13:

- **Strict contracts**: build-time verification, versioning, documentation; but tighter coupling, versioning overhead
- **Loose contracts**: high decoupling, evolutionary flexibility; but contract management overhead, requires fitness functions

The recommendation: prefer loose contracts; use consumer-driven contracts to manage drift.

### Simplicity vs Flexibility (YAGNI vs Speculative Generality)

Pragmatic Programmer's framing:

- **Simplicity**: build for what you need now; YAGNI; less to maintain
- **Flexibility**: anticipate future needs; build extension points; more upfront effort, less rework later

Speculative generality (over-flexibility for hypothetical needs) is anti-pattern; under-flexibility (every change requires rewrite) is also anti-pattern. Articulating the choice for each design decision is the discipline.

## Recognizing trade-off articulation discipline

### Smell: "always" / "never" recommendations

> "You should always use microservices."  
> "You should never use shared databases."

These are the absence of articulation. Real recommendations sound like:

> "In the context of independent team scalability, microservices' deployment-independence pays for the operational overhead. In a single-team context with low traffic, the trade-off inverts."

Or:

> "Shared databases work when teams accept the schema-coupling cost. They fail when the operational coupling exceeds the cost-of-migration to per-service databases."

### Smell: "best practices" without context

A generic "best practice" recommendation that doesn't say *for what context* is ungrounded. The real question for any "best practice" is "best for whom?"

Per Hard Parts: "Generic solutions are rarely useful in real-world architectures without applying additional situation-specific context."

### Smell: missing the sacrifice

A proposal that emphasizes only benefits is half a proposal:

> "We should adopt event sourcing for better auditability."

Half-proposal. The full version:

> "We should adopt event sourcing for better auditability. The sacrifice is increased complexity (events as primary state, current state as derived; replay-from-log adds operational complexity). Our auditability requirement justifies this trade-off because [specific use case]."

The sacrifice doesn't have to defeat the proposal — it just has to be acknowledged and weighed.

### Smell: claims that one option dominates another

> "Postgres is strictly better than MySQL."  
> "Async is strictly better than sync."

Strict-domination claims are red flags. If one option were strictly better, there'd be no trade-off; the discussion would be over. Real engineering involves picking among options that are different in different dimensions.

## Patterns for trade-off articulation

### Pattern 1: The "What's Sacrificed" Question

When proposing a recommendation, articulate:

- What's gained
- What's sacrificed
- Under what context this trade is favorable
- Under what context it's unfavorable

Substrate's H.7.22 Principle Audit requirement implements this for architect-driven plans: ADRs MUST include a Principle Audit section with explicit articulation of sacrifices and trade-offs.

### Pattern 2: The Trade-off Matrix

For complex decisions with multiple dimensions, build a matrix: rows are options, columns are quality attributes (reliability, scalability, simplicity, etc.), cells are values (or qualitative scores).

Hard Parts ch 12's Saga types include exactly such a matrix: 7 saga types × 6 dimensions (responsiveness/availability, scale/elasticity, consistency, communication, coordination, coupling). The matrix exposes that no saga is best on every dimension; choosing requires articulating which dimensions matter most.

### Pattern 3: "Design It Twice" (Ousterhout PoSD ch 11)

For important decisions, design at least two alternatives. Compare on:

- Which has the simpler interface?
- Which is more general-purpose?
- Which enables more efficient implementation?
- Which sacrifices less?

The act of comparing forces articulation. Designing only one option is "feels right" engineering; designing two (or more) is trade-off discipline.

### Pattern 4: ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

Capture each significant decision as an ADR with:

- Context (what problem are we solving)
- Decision (what we chose)
- Consequences (what we sacrifice + what we gain)
- Alternatives considered (showing the trade-off space was explored)
- Status (proposed / accepted / deprecated / superseded)

ADRs are durable trade-off articulation. Six months later, when someone questions the decision, the ADR explains why — including the sacrifice that was acceptable at the time.

### Pattern 5: Hostile Architect Workflow

After an architect proposes a design, run a "hostile architect" pass: another role intentionally argues *against* the design, focusing on:

- What goes wrong under high load?
- What goes wrong under team churn?
- What goes wrong if assumptions change?
- What other approaches were rejected and why?

The hostile pass forces explicit articulation of trade-offs. Substrate's H.7.22+ Pre-Approval Verification (parallel architect + code-reviewer spawn before ExitPlanMode) implements this: architect proposes; code-reviewer challenges; trade-offs surface; both must agree before plan ships.

### Pattern 6: Fitness Functions (Building Evolutionary Architectures)

Per *Building Evolutionary Architectures* (Ford / Parsons / Kua, 2017): a fitness function is an automated check that an architectural quality is preserved. Examples: tests that fail if cyclic dependencies appear; tests that fail if API response times exceed threshold; tests that fail if module count exceeds budget.

Fitness functions automate the trade-off articulation: when a change violates a fitness function, the trade-off is surfaced (we're sacrificing X for Y; do we accept?).

## Substrate-Specific Examples

### H.7.22 Principle Audit requirement

The substrate's load-bearing trade-off-articulation discipline. Per H.7.22:

- Architect ADRs MUST include a `## Principle Audit` section
- Plan-schema validator (H.7.22 + H.7.23) checks for Principle Audit on HETS-routed plans
- `04-architect.contract.json` F6 (`containsKeywords` on Principle Audit) enforces structurally
- Pre-Approval Verification spawns architect + code-reviewer; both must produce explicit trade-off articulation

This is trade-off articulation as substrate primitive. The discipline isn't "we hope architects articulate"; it's "the substrate refuses to ship plans that don't articulate."

### Convention G's failure modes section (H.7.25)

When H.7.25 codified the forcing-instruction class taxonomy, the failure-modes section explicitly articulates the trade-offs:

- "Class 1 with mechanical recovery": class assignment violation; symptom is low landing rate
- "Class 2 dressed as Class 1": false count growth; symptom is no Claude-side action history
- "Class 1 when variant fits": silent failure mode
- "Variant when Class 1 fits": friction mode

Each failure mode is an explicit articulation of "what's sacrificed if you violate this convention." The convention isn't preachy — it's empirically grounded in observed failure modes.

### The 5 / 9 active marker count after H.7.27

Per H.7.25 Convention G discipline + H.7.26 + H.7.27 consolidation: the substrate moved from 11 → 9 → 8 forcing instructions. Each retirement was an explicit trade-off articulation:

- `[CONFIRMATION-UNCERTAIN]` retired (consolidated into PROMPT-ENRICHMENT-GATE tier): trade was performative-differentiation vs unified-marker; chose unified
- `[PLUGIN-NOT-LOADED]` retired (state already covered by SessionStart stderr): trade was redundant-emission vs single-layer; chose single
- `[MARKDOWN-EMPHASIS-DRIFT]` retired (mechanical recovery; markdownlint absorbs): trade was forcing-instruction-shape vs lint-pipeline-shape; chose lint

Each retirement decision is documented in the catalog with the trade-off articulation. The substrate doesn't just shrink the family; it explains *why* each retirement was favorable.

### Drift-notes as captured trade-offs

The substrate's drift-note convention captures observed trade-offs that didn't resolve cleanly:

- Drift-note 21 (forcing-instruction architectural smell): the trade-off between count growth and discipline; resolved in H.7.25 by reframing
- Drift-note 47 (forcing-instruction shared helper extraction): trade-off between DRY and premature-extraction; deferred until 7+ callers
- Drift-note 56 (cap rule N=15 magic number): trade-off between cap-as-discipline and cap-as-arbitrary; revisit after first audit

Each drift-note is a trade-off articulation that defers resolution. The articulation itself is the value: future maintainers can see the trade-off was considered, not just that one side was picked.

### Pre-Approval Verification as trade-off enforcement (4-for-4 success)

The H.7.22+ Pre-Approval Verification process is the substrate's load-bearing trade-off-articulation enforcement: architect + code-reviewer parallel spawn; both must produce structured findings with explicit trade-off statements; gate at ExitPlanMode blocks if articulation is missing.

Across H.7.22-H.7.25, the process caught:
- 4 HIGH bugs (H.7.22)
- 5 substantive issues (H.7.23)  
- 1 FAIL + 7 FLAGs (H.7.24)
- 7 FLAGs (H.7.25)

These weren't just bug catches — they were trade-off articulation gaps. Each FLAG was "you chose this without acknowledging the sacrifice." The process surfaces the sacrifice; the architect either accepts and articulates, or revises.

### Soak period as explicit trade-off

The H.7.27 commitment to "5+ phases with 0 new drift-notes before v2.0" is explicit trade-off articulation: gain (substrate stability validation; v2.0 ships from a known-stable state) vs sacrifice (defer new substrate features; soak period blocks substantive changes).

The articulation made the trade favorable: stability before features makes the eventual v2.0 release more credible than "new features merged this week." The soak window is explicitly time-bounded so the sacrifice doesn't compound.

## Tension with Other Principles

### Trade-off Articulation vs Decision Speed

Articulating trade-offs takes time. For most decisions, you could just pick and move on faster.

**Heuristic** (per Hard Parts ch 15): articulate proportional to decision impact. Local decisions (function design, naming) need light articulation (mention the alternative briefly). Architectural decisions (modular monolith vs microservices, sync vs async, consistency choice) need full articulation. The cost of *not* articulating compounds for high-impact decisions; for low-impact, articulation overhead exceeds value.

### Trade-off Articulation vs YAGNI

YAGNI says don't build flexibility for hypothetical needs. Trade-off articulation says consider alternatives — which can look like designing for hypotheticals.

**Resolution**: articulating doesn't require building. Document the trade-off; build the chosen option. The articulation lives in the ADR / Principle Audit / drift-note; the code is whatever the chosen option requires.

### Trade-off Articulation vs Authority

Sometimes a senior architect makes a call without articulation; the team trusts. This is anti-pattern even when the call is right — the next decision (without that architect) won't have the same trust + intuition basis.

**Counter**: articulating is a long-term discipline. Even when the call is obvious, articulating the trade-off documents the reasoning for future decisions in similar contexts.

### Trade-off Articulation vs Disagreement Stability

If every decision is explicitly articulated, every decision can be re-litigated when context shifts. This sounds good (trade-offs evolve!) but in practice it produces churn.

**Heuristic**: articulate at decision time; capture in durable artifact (ADR); re-evaluate only when context changes meaningfully. Don't re-litigate articulated decisions absent new evidence.

## When to use this principle

- Always for architectural decisions (module boundaries, layer choices, communication patterns, consistency models)
- Always when proposing a "best practice" — articulate "best for what context"
- When team members disagree — surface the underlying trade-off; the disagreement is usually about which dimension to prioritize
- In retrospectives — what trade-offs were implicit but should have been explicit?

## When NOT to use this principle (or apply with caveat)

- **Trivial decisions**: function naming, variable naming, formatting — light articulation; sometimes none needed
- **Time-critical decisions**: production incidents may require immediate action; articulate after the fact in postmortem
- **Decisions with no real alternatives**: occasionally a choice is forced (only one library exists; only one approach satisfies the constraint); articulating absent alternatives is theater

## Failure modes when applied incorrectly

- **Articulation theater**: writing trade-off sections that don't actually consider alternatives. Solution: design two alternatives; compare; document the comparison.
- **Articulation paralysis**: spending more time articulating than deciding. Solution: scope articulation to decision impact.
- **Stale articulation**: ADRs documented at one time; context shifts; ADR not revisited. Solution: ADR status field (proposed/accepted/superseded); periodic review of "accepted" decisions for context drift.
- **Misleading articulation**: articulating one trade-off while hiding another. Solution: hostile architect / pre-approval verification surfacing missed dimensions.

## Tests / verification

- **ADR audit**: do all significant decisions have ADRs? Spot-check by sampling recent commits.
- **Principle Audit completeness**: does every architect-driven plan have a Principle Audit section? Validator-enforced in substrate.
- **Re-articulation test**: can a developer who wasn't in the original decision discussion reproduce the reasoning from the ADR alone? If no, articulation was incomplete.
- **Hostile-architect test**: when challenged, does the proposer have a coherent response? If not, the trade-off wasn't articulated to themselves.
