## Summary

**Principle**: Handle errors at the OUTER layers; inner code lets errors propagate. Only the outer layer (caller, request handler, top-level loop) has the context to decide.
**Even better**: design errors out of existence (Ousterhout) — eliminate the conditions that produce them.
**Wrong pattern**: catching at every layer (catch-and-re-raise tower). **Worst**: silencing exceptions (`except: pass`).
**Sources**: PoSD ch 10 + Clean Code ch 7 + charlax error-handling-antipatterns + Pragmatic Programmer + Release It! + end-to-end-principle blog post.
**Substrate**: forcing instructions IS this principle; fail-open hooks (graceful degradation WITH observability).

## Quick Reference

**Principle**: "Error handling and recovery are best done at the outer layers of your code base. This is known as the end-to-end principle." (charlax / programmingisterrible.com)

**Why catching at every layer fails**:

- **Catch-and-rethrow tower**: stack traces become cryptic; original error lost; each layer adds maintenance burden without value
- **Silencing antipattern** ("the most diabolical Python antipattern" — realpython.com): debugging impossible; silent UX degradation; identification impossible; state corruption
- **Unconstrained defensive programming**: low-level fallbacks become magical conventions; new developers don't know about them; silent degradation when upstream fails

**Seven patterns for end-to-end error handling**:

1. **Let inner layers propagate** — no try/except in the inner; let it raise
2. **Catch at outermost meaningful layer** — request handler, event loop, orchestrator
3. **Define errors out of existence** (Ousterhout PoSD ch 10) — design API so exceptions don't arise; clamp inputs; use Optional/sentinel objects
4. **Mask exceptions at low levels** — when exception is well-defined and high level shouldn't see it (cache misses, retryable transients)
5. **Aggregate exceptions at single point** — one catch block at request boundary
6. **Re-raise immediately when you must catch** — bare `raise` preserves original
7. **Crash the application** when the right call (OOM, invariant violations, config corruption)

**Top smells**:

- try/except in every function (most should let errors propagate)
- Bare `except:` clauses (catches SystemExit, KeyboardInterrupt)
- Catching exceptions you can't actually handle (returning sentinel that callers can't disambiguate)
- Error messages that paraphrase the function name (no value-add)
- "Graceful degradation" that hides the degradation (silent fallbacks)

**Tensions**:

- **Postel's Law**: applies at protocol boundaries (parse liberally); does NOT mean silently ignore internal errors
- **Fail-Fast**: applies *inside* a process; end-to-end applies *across* layers; partners
- **Defensive programming**: at system edges (input validation), not in the middle

**Substrate examples**:

- Forcing-instruction architecture IS end-to-end: substrate detects deterministically; emits structured signal; outer layer (Claude) decides recovery
- Fail-open hook discipline: errors logged + operation continues — graceful degradation WITH observability (not silencing)
- `error-critic.js` consolidation at outer Bash layer: aggregates failures at substrate-Bash boundary
- `verify-plan-gate.js` workflow-level catch: catches "missing Pre-Approval Verification" at exit boundary, not at every plan-edit step
- Atomic-rename for tracker files: lets atomic rename either succeed or fail entirely; doesn't try to recover from partial-write
- `kb-resolver` content-hash mismatch: raises rather than silently returning drift; calling agent decides

## Intent

Error handling is one of the worst sources of complexity in software systems (per Ousterhout, PoSD ch 10). Most of that complexity is self-inflicted: developers catch exceptions at the layer where they occur, even when the layer has no useful response, and either:

1. **Silence** the exception (return None, log-and-continue, bare `except: pass`) — corrupts state, hides bugs, makes debugging impossible
2. **Wrap-and-rethrow** with a less-informative error type — turns a precise stack trace into a cryptic chain
3. **Recover with a fallback** that doesn't actually solve the problem — magical conventions that callers don't know about

The end-to-end principle says: errors should travel from where they occur to where they can be meaningfully handled, without intermediate interception. The only place where context exists to decide what to do (retry? abort? alert the user? fail the request?) is the outer layer.

## The Principle

> "Error handling, and recovery are best done at the outer layers of your code base. This is known as the end-to-end principle. The end-to-end principle argues that it is easier to handle failure at the far ends of a connection than anywhere in the middle." — *Write Code That Is Easy to Delete, Not Easy to Extend* (cited in charlax/error-handling-antipatterns)

Reformulated for software:

- **Inner code lets errors propagate** — it does not catch unless it has a specific recovery action
- **The outermost meaningful layer catches** — the request handler, the event loop, the top-level orchestrator
- **Catching at every layer is anti-pattern** — wrapping-and-rethrowing duplicates work, loses information, accumulates noise
- **Silencing is the worst pattern** — corrupts state and hides bugs

The principle has a deeper origin: the [end-to-end argument in system design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle) (Saltzer/Reed/Clark, 1981), which argued that functions placed at low levels of a system may be redundant or of little value compared to functions placed at the ends. Applied to error handling: the inner layer has no context to recover; only the end (outer layer) has the context.

## Why catching at every layer fails

### The catch-and-re-raise tower (charlax)

```python
def call_1():
    try:
        call_2()
    except Call2Exception:
        raise Call1Exception()  # ❌ wraps with less info

def call_2():
    try:
        call_3()
    except Call3Exception:
        raise Call2Exception()  # ❌ wraps again

def call_3():
    # ... actual error happens here
```

Failure modes of this pattern:

- **Stack traces become cryptic**: original error is lost; only the outermost wrapper is visible
- **Each layer must catch + rewrap**: maintenance burden multiplies with depth
- **Pretending to handle when you're just relabeling**: the operation still fails; you've added complexity without adding value

The substrate has occasionally exhibited this: pre-H.7.10, `error-critic.js` had its own catch-blocks at multiple layers; post-H.7.10 cleanup, errors propagate to the outer layer where they're caught once, logged, and counted toward the failure-repeated threshold.

### The silencing antipattern (the most diabolical)

Per realpython.com (cited in charlax/error-handling-antipatterns): silencing exceptions is "the most diabolical Python antipattern."

```python
def toast(bread):
    try:
        toaster = Toaster()
        toaster.insert(bread)
        toaster.toast()
    except:
        pass  # ❌ DIABOLICAL
```

Why it's diabolical:

- **Debugging impossibility**: silenced errors don't show up in logs or Sentry
- **Silent UX degradation**: users get wrong results without anyone knowing
- **Identification impossibility**: HTTP timeouts, undefined variables, network errors — all invisible
- **State corruption**: partial work may have been done; system is now inconsistent
- **Compounds with every retry**: if the operation is retried, the silenced first attempt may have done partial work that the retry conflicts with

Variants of silencing:

- `except: pass` — bare; catches everything including KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit
- `except Exception: log.warn(...)` — slightly less bad; still hides the real problem
- `except SpecificException: return None` — returns sentinel value that callers don't know is "failed"
- `try: ... except: return False` — converts an exception to a boolean; callers can't distinguish "false" from "error"

### The unconstrained defensive programming antipattern (charlax)

```python
def get_user_name(user_id):
    url = f'http://internal-svc/users/{user_id}'
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status == 404:
        return 'unknown'  # ❌ silent fallback
    return response.data
```

The fallback is well-intentioned but disastrous when the upstream service is degraded:

- A new developer doesn't know `'unknown'` is a magic-fallback value; treats it as a real user name
- If upstream returns 404 for ALL users (service degraded), every user becomes `'unknown'` silently
- The actual problem (upstream service is broken) is now invisible

**Fix**: raise on 404; let the caller (outer layer) decide what to do — show "user not found" message, retry later, fall back to cached value, etc. The caller has the context the function lacks.

## Patterns for End-to-End Error Handling

### Pattern 1: Let inner layers propagate

```python
def toast(bread):
    # No try/except. Errors propagate up.
    toaster = Toaster()
    toaster.insert(bread)
    toaster.toast()
```

The function is shorter, clearer, and correct: when something fails, it raises; the caller decides.

### Pattern 2: Catch at the outermost meaningful layer

```python
def main():
    try:
        toast('brioche')
    except ToastingException:
        logger.exception('Could not toast bread')
        statsd.count('toast.error', 1)
        # Optionally: return error response to user; or retry; or escalate
```

The outermost layer has context: "this is a user request handler; if toasting fails, we tell the user and increment a metric." The inner `toast()` couldn't make that decision; the outer can.

### Pattern 3: Define errors out of existence (Ousterhout PoSD ch 10)

The most powerful: design APIs so errors don't arise in the first place.

Example: `Substring(s, start, end)` traditionally raises `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if indices exceed string length. Ousterhout's design: the function silently clamps indices to valid range, returning a (possibly empty) substring. No exception possible; the caller doesn't have to handle the error case.

Generalization:

- **Replace exceptions with empty results**: instead of "throw if list empty," return an empty list
- **Replace exceptions with sentinel objects**: instead of "throw if not found," return a "Null Object" that responds gracefully
- **Replace exceptions with optional types**: `Optional<User>` rather than "throw if user not found"
- **Replace exceptions with deterministic clamping**: clamp inputs to valid ranges silently

The technique is "design special cases out of existence." Many error conditions are design choices, not inherent to the problem.

### Pattern 4: Mask exceptions at low levels (Ousterhout PoSD ch 10)

When a low-level exception is well-defined and the high level shouldn't see it:

```python
def get_or_compute(key):
    try:
        return cache.get(key)
    except CacheMiss:
        # Mask the cache-miss exception; recompute and return
        value = compute(key)
        cache.set(key, value)
        return value
```

The caller never sees `CacheMiss`. The cache abstraction handles its own miss internally; the caller gets a value (or a real error if the computation itself fails).

This is a legitimate pattern when:

- The exception is genuinely abstractable (cache misses are an implementation detail; callers shouldn't care)
- The recovery is well-defined and doesn't require caller context
- The exception class is at a *lower abstraction level* than the caller

When it's NOT legitimate:

- The exception carries information the caller needs (e.g., `UserNotFound` is a domain concept, not just a database miss)
- The recovery requires caller-specific context (don't decide for them)

### Pattern 5: Aggregate exceptions at a single point

```python
def process_request(req):
    try:
        validate(req)
        execute(req)
        respond(req)
    except (ValidationError, ExecutionError, ResponseError) as e:
        # One handler aggregates exceptions from the entire request
        logger.exception('Request processing failed', extra={'req_id': req.id})
        return error_response(e)
```

The pattern: one catch block at the request boundary handles all exceptions from the entire processing flow. Inner functions don't need their own handlers.

This works especially well in event-loop / request-handler architectures (web servers, message-queue consumers, command processors). The outermost loop catches anything that escapes; logs; cleans up; continues with the next request.

### Pattern 6: Re-raise immediately when you must catch

If you must catch (e.g., to add context, log, or clean up), re-raise the original:

```python
def toast(bread):
    try:
        put_in_toaster(bread)
    except:
        logger.exception('Could not toast bread %r', bread)
        raise  # ← re-raise unchanged; preserves the original
```

The bare `raise` (no argument) preserves the original stack trace and exception type. This is fundamentally different from `raise WrappedException()`, which loses information.

### Pattern 7: Crash the application (when it's the right call)

Per Ousterhout (PoSD ch 10): some errors aren't worth handling; print diagnostic info and abort.

Examples:

- Out-of-memory in a server process — better to crash and let supervisor restart than continue with degraded state
- Configuration corruption at startup — better to fail-fast than start with broken config
- Invariant violations in core data structures — indicate a bug; continuing produces unpredictable results

The substrate uses this pattern when hooks encounter genuinely unhandleable errors: log loudly to stderr, exit non-zero, let Claude Code retry the operation in a fresh process.

## Recognizing violations

### Smell: try/except in every function

If most functions in the codebase have try/except blocks, error handling has been over-applied. Most functions should let errors propagate; only specific outer-layer functions should catch.

**Heuristic** (per charlax + Pragmatic Programmer): try/except should be the exception in the codebase, not the rule. If you can't quickly answer "why does this function need to catch?", it probably doesn't.

### Smell: bare `except:` clauses

```python
try:
    ...
except:  # ❌ catches everything including SystemExit, KeyboardInterrupt
    ...
```

In Python specifically, bare `except:` catches `BaseException`, including `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt`. This is almost always wrong. Use `except Exception` if you must catch broadly.

### Smell: catching exceptions you can't actually handle

```python
def parse_date(s):
    try:
        return datetime.strptime(s, '%Y-%m-%d')
    except ValueError:
        return None  # ❌ what is the caller supposed to do with None?
```

If the caller can't tell whether `None` means "not a valid date" or "the date was None," the error swallowing has lost information. **Fix**: raise a structured `InvalidDateError` and let the caller decide; or use `Optional[datetime]` with explicit handling at the caller; or raise + caller catches at the request boundary.

### Smell: error messages that paraphrase the function name

```python
def save_user(user):
    try:
        db.save(user)
    except DatabaseError:
        raise UserSaveError('Could not save user')  # ❌ adds nothing
```

If the wrapped exception adds no new information, don't wrap. Either:

- Don't catch — let `DatabaseError` propagate
- Catch + log specific context (the user ID, the operation context) + re-raise unchanged

### Smell: "graceful degradation" that hides degradation

```python
def fetch_dashboard_data(user_id):
    try:
        return external_service.fetch(user_id)
    except ServiceTimeout:
        return {}  # ❌ user sees an empty dashboard with no indication of why
```

The user sees an empty dashboard. They have no way to know whether they have no data or whether the service is down. The "graceful degradation" hides the actual problem.

**Fix**: the *outer* layer (UI rendering) is the right place to decide on degradation behavior — show a "service temporarily unavailable" message; offer cached data; etc. The fetch function should just raise; the UI handles the user experience.

## Substrate-Specific Examples

### Forcing instructions as end-to-end error handling

The substrate's forcing-instruction architecture IS the end-to-end principle in action. When a hook detects drift / vagueness / schema violation / etc., it doesn't try to fix it itself — it emits a forcing instruction (bracketed marker) that propagates to Claude (the outer layer with semantic-understanding context) for resolution.

The hook layer:

- Detects deterministically (regex, schema check, file presence)
- Doesn't attempt semantic recovery
- Emits a structured signal (the forcing instruction)
- Lets the outer layer (Claude) decide

The outer layer (Claude reading the forcing instruction) has the context (user intent, prior turn, project state) the hook lacks. The result: deterministic detection + semantic recovery, properly factored.

This is the substrate's core architectural pattern. It would be unworkable as "hooks attempting to fix the problem themselves" — they don't have the context. Forcing instructions formalize the end-to-end principle as a substrate primitive.

### Fail-open hook architecture

The substrate's hooks intentionally fail-open: when the hook itself encounters an error (e.g., `JSON.parse` fails on malformed input, file system unavailable, etc.), the hook logs the error and exits cleanly, *not* blocking the operation:

```js
try {
    const data = JSON.parse(input);
    // ... validation logic
} catch (err) {
    logger.error({ err: err.message });
    process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify({ decision: 'approve' }));
    return;
}
```

This is fail-open with observability — distinct from silencing. The error is logged (visible in `~/.claude/logs/<hook>.log`); the operation continues (substrate is not allowed to break Claude Code sessions); future maintainers see the failure pattern. This is the right shape: graceful degradation WITH observability, not silencing.

The line: "graceful degradation with observability" (legitimate) vs "silently swallowing errors" (antipattern). The substrate is the former because every fail-open path goes through `logger.error`.

### `error-critic.js` consolidation at the outer layer (H.7.7)

Per H.7.7, `error-critic.js` is a PostToolUse:Bash hook that catches Bash command failures *at the outer Bash layer* — not inside specific commands, not inside specific scripts, but at the substrate-Bash boundary. When a command fails, the hook:

1. Logs the failure with a deterministic key (command + working dir + error pattern hash)
2. Counts repeats per session
3. On the second matching failure, emits `[FAILURE-REPEATED]` forcing instruction

The pattern is end-to-end error handling at the substrate scale: individual scripts don't try to recover from their own Bash failures; the outer hook layer aggregates failures and decides when to escalate to Claude.

### `verify-plan-gate.js` block-and-retry (H.7.23.1)

The PreToolUse:ExitPlanMode hook catches "missing Pre-Approval Verification section" at the outermost meaningful boundary (just before plan exit). Inside the plan-writing process, no error is raised — the plan is whatever Claude wrote. At the exit point, the gate checks; if missing, blocks with a forcing instruction. Claude reads, runs `/verify-plan` (which adds the section idempotently), retries.

This is end-to-end error handling at the workflow level: don't catch "plan is incomplete" at every plan-edit step; catch it once at the exit boundary where the cost of incomplete-plan is concrete.

### Atomic-rename for tracker file safety (multiple hooks)

Per H.3.6 / H.7.10: tracker file mutations use atomic rename. The pattern doesn't try-and-handle filesystem failures inside the rename — it lets atomic-rename either succeed or fail entirely. When it fails (disk full, permission denied), the error propagates up to the substrate's outer fail-open layer, which logs and continues.

This is "let errors propagate" applied to filesystem operations: don't try to recover from a failed rename; either it succeeded (and we have a consistent file) or it failed (and we have the previous consistent file). Either way, the system invariant is preserved.

### `kb-resolver` content-hash mismatch handling

When a KB ref's hash doesn't match the resolved content (drift since snapshot), `kb-resolver` raises an error rather than silently returning the new content. The error propagates to the calling agent / orchestrator, which has the context to decide: refresh the snapshot, fail the run, alert the user, etc.

This is the right factoring: kb-resolver doesn't have the context to decide what to do about hash drift; the outer layer does.

## Tension with Other Principles

### End-to-End vs Robustness Principle (Postel's Law)

Postel's Law: "Be conservative in what you do; be liberal in what you accept from others." This suggests *accepting* malformed input gracefully — which can look like the silencing antipattern.

**Resolution**: Postel's Law applies at protocol boundaries (parsing user input, parsing wire formats); it does NOT mean "silently ignore errors in business logic." Internal errors should propagate; external malformed data should be parsed liberally and either rejected with structured errors or normalized.

### End-to-End vs Fail-Fast

Fail-fast says: as soon as something is wrong, stop loudly. End-to-end says: let errors propagate to where they can be handled. Same principle, different emphases:

- Fail-fast applies *inside* a process — bugs should crash early, not produce wrong results
- End-to-end applies *across* layers — errors should reach the boundary where context exists
- Together: fail-fast at the bug; propagate the failure end-to-end to the outer handler; the outer handler can decide whether to retry, alert, or crash entirely

### End-to-End vs Idempotency

Idempotency says: design operations to absorb retries safely. End-to-end says: let errors propagate so retries can be safe. The two are partners:

- Without idempotency, end-to-end retry is dangerous (duplicates)
- Without end-to-end propagation, idempotency machinery is wasted (errors get swallowed mid-stack)

Substrate exhibits both: hooks fail-open with observability (end-to-end propagation to logs); hook validators are idempotent (same input → same decision); retries are therefore safe.

### End-to-End vs Defensive Programming

Defensive programming says: validate everything, handle every possible error. End-to-end says: only handle errors where you have context.

**Heuristic** (per Ousterhout PoSD ch 10): defensive programming has its place at the boundary (validating user input, type-checking external data); inside the system, it's noise. Use defensive programming at the system's *edges*; rely on end-to-end propagation in the *middle*.

## When to use this principle

- Always at the architectural-layer boundary (request handler, event loop, orchestrator)
- For all internal function design — let errors propagate by default
- When designing public APIs — define which exceptions are part of the contract; let everything else propagate
- When refactoring legacy code with try/except in every function — most can be removed

## When NOT to use this principle (or apply with caveat)

- **At external boundaries**: must validate input, normalize formats, handle malformed data — Postel's Law applies
- **For specific recoverable errors with well-defined recovery**: cache misses, retryable transient failures (with explicit idempotency), expected business-logic errors
- **For graceful-degradation cases where the outer layer can't decide**: e.g., a metric collection failure shouldn't block a request — handle it locally with logging
- **For very narrow specific cases where the recovery is genuinely the local layer's responsibility**: file-not-found in a "create-or-load" operation; etc. (and even here, Pattern 3 — define errors out of existence — is often better)

## Failure modes when applied incorrectly

- **Failing to handle at the outermost layer**: errors propagate all the way up to the runtime, crashing the whole process. Solution: ensure the outermost meaningful layer has a catch.
- **Premature outer-layer catch**: catching at "outer" but not "outermost" — request middleware that catches everything but doesn't propagate to the framework's error handler. Solution: identify the right outer layer (often farther out than first instinct).
- **Catching too broad**: `except Exception:` at the outer layer can mask programming bugs alongside operational errors. Solution: catch specific expected exception types; let bugs propagate to be visible.
- **Forgetting to log**: end-to-end propagation works only if the outer layer logs / alerts / tracks. A silent outer-layer catch is the silencing antipattern at scale.

## Tests / verification

- **Stack trace inspection**: when an error occurs, does the stack trace reach back to the original cause? If wrapped/silenced, no.
- **Log inspection**: are errors visible in logs / Sentry / metrics? If silenced, no.
- **Regression test**: simulate a downstream failure (mock service raising an exception); verify the outer layer handles it correctly (logged + appropriate response to user).
- **Audit grep**: search for `except:` (bare) and `except Exception` patterns; review each to confirm legitimate use.
- **Audit grep**: search for `try` followed by `raise NewException(...)` patterns; flag for review (most should be removed).

- [architecture/crosscut/single-responsibility](../crosscut/single-responsibility.md) — error handling is a separate responsibility from the primary work; SRP says don't mix them in the same function
