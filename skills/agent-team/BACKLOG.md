# Agent Team — Backlog

Deferred work from prior phases, captured here so nothing important gets silently dropped. Each entry: scope, rationale, dependencies, rough estimate.

## Phase H.5.7 — Engineering-task contract template — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped via the corrected autonomous-platform pattern (theo designed; kira implemented; root coordinated). Closes M-5 from H.6.9 ("contract-shape mismatch — 4/5 cycle tasks contorted engineering work into audit-shape") + the original H.5.6 H-1 finding from `12-security-engineer.mio`.

### Motivating event

`03-code-reviewer.nova` produced a 9-line BACKLOG cleanup report (genuine signal: 2 findings + 1 file citation for trivial doc surgery) that received `verdict fail` against `03-code-reviewer.contract.json` — not because the work was bad, but because audit-shape thresholds (`minFindings ≥ 3`, `hasFileCitations ≥ 6`, `hasSeveritySections [CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW]`) were the wrong shape for engineering-style trivial cleanup. The H.5.7 problem became live in real time.

### What landed

- **New `swarm/personas-contracts/engineering-task.contract.json`** — generic shared template mirroring `challenger.contract.json`'s shape:
  - `agentId: actor-engineering-task`, `persona: <set-at-spawn>`, `role: actor` (explicit, MEDIUM-1)
  - Engineering-fit thresholds: `F3 minFindings ≥ 1`, `F4 hasFileCitations ≥ 1` (vs audit's 3 + 6)
  - F5 `noUnrolledLoops` + F6 `noExcessiveNesting` preserved unchanged (structural defenses apply uniformly)
  - F7 `kb_scope_consumed` retained (graceful pass when no transcript supplied)
  - `hasSeveritySections` + `containsKeywords` REMOVED (audit-shaped checks invite "## CRITICAL\n\nNone." padding)
  - A4 `acknowledgesFallback` REMOVED (same pad-pressure; HIGH-2 from theo's review)
  - F3 `_doc` clarified: findings are H3 sub-sections under severity blocks, not Summary text (HIGH-4)
  - Token budget: 35K + 1×15K extension to 50K (matches 13-node-backend.contract.json:28-33)

- **`commands/build-team.md` Step 7 task-type heuristic** — explicit `--task-type` override path + extended audit-verb regex (`audit|review|assess|analyze|investigate|check|verify|inspect|examine|find vulnerabilities`); audit-precedence by design for mixed-mode tasks; engineering as fallback default (1+1 thresholds make permissive contract no-regression-risk).

- **`patterns/structural-code-review.md`** cross-link — new "Engineering vs Audit Tasks" subsection confirming F5/F6 apply uniformly across both task types via the H.5.7 template.

### Self-test (nova-recovery)

Re-verifying nova's exact same output against `engineering-task.contract.json` yields `verdict pass; functionalFailures: 0; antiPatternFailures: 0`. Closes the loop: the LAST run under audit-shape contract ships the engineering-shape contract template.

### Cycle data (pair-run via H.7.1 asymmetric-challenger pattern)

- `04-architect.theo` (design pass): 16 findings + 67 citations, PASS
- `13-node-backend.kira` (implementation pass): paired verdict
- Both recorded with `--paired-with` + `--convergence agree`

### Acceptance tests passed

- `node -e 'JSON.parse(...)'` — JSON valid
- `grep "H.5.7 — task-type heuristic" commands/build-team.md` — heuristic flow inserted
- `grep "Engineering vs Audit Tasks" skills/agent-team/patterns/structural-code-review.md` — cross-link present
- `node scripts/agent-team/contracts-validate.js` — 0 violations across all 7 validators

### H.5.7 follow-ups (deferred)

- **Per-spawn `--task-type` propagation**: today the heuristic lives at build-team Step 7. Orchestrators invoking spawn machinery directly (outside `/build-team`) need to pass `--contract` explicitly — future phase could add `--task-type` to `spawn_implementer` itself.
- **Engineering-task contract for OLDER outputs**: F2 requires `identity` field, present only post-H.7.0 spawn convention. For pre-H.7.0 reports the audit contract still applies; future migration if older outputs need re-verification.
- **Update `kb:hets/spawn-conventions`** to mention contract-selection-by-task-type as a discoverable convention (per H.6.9 M-1 follow-up).

## Phase H.7.2 — Theory-driven weighted trust score — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped via corrected autonomous-platform pattern (mira designed; evan implemented; root coordinated). Closes the "rich measurement, binary signal" gap — quality axes now contribute to within-tier ranking without breaking the H.4.2 audit-transparency commitment.

### What landed
- `agent-identity.js:198` — new `computeWeightedTrustScore(stats, aggregateQF)` + `WEIGHTS` + `REFERENCE_SCALES` + `BONUS_CAP` constants + `normalizeAxis()` helper
- `agent-identity.js:325-356` — `cmdStats --identity` adds `weighted_trust_score` field
- `patterns/agent-identity-reputation.md` — new "Weighted Trust Score (H.7.2 — supplemental signal)" subsection with worked example (ari)
- **`tierOf` UNCHANGED** — H.4.2 commitment honored

### Weights (theory-driven; refit at H.7.3)
| Axis | Weight | Citation |
|------|--------|----------|
| findings_per_10k | +0.10 | Dunsmore 2003 |
| file_citations_per_finding | +0.10 | Bacchelli & Bird MSR 2013 |
| cap_request_actionability | +0.05 | Small-sample noise control |
| kb_provenance_verified_pct | +0.10 | Contract compliance |
| convergence_agree_pct | **+0.15** | Cohen's κ / Krippendorff's α |
| tokens | -0.05 | Efficiency penalty |

Bonus cap [-0.10, +0.50]. Final score clamp [0, 1]. mira's calibration adjustment: file_citations_per_finding reference high raised 4.0 → 6.0 to prevent ceiling-clamp on real data.

### Cycle data
- mira: pass=4, weighted_trust_score=1.000 (clamped), bonus=+0.198, convergence_agree_pct=1.0
- evan: pass=2, weighted_trust_score=1.000 (clamped), bonus=+0.193, convergence_agree_pct=1.0
- Toolkit-wide builder verdicts: 9 → **11** (55% of way to n=20)

### H.7.2 follow-ups (deferred)
- **H.7.3 — Empirical refit**: at ≥20 verdicts, fit weights from accumulated `quality_factors_history`; compare theory-driven vs empirical-fit; document deltas. Today: 11 verdicts; need 9 more.
- **`HETS_WEIGHT_PROFILE` env override**: per-org calibration of reference scales. Future phase.
- **`cap_request_actionability` weight tuning**: today +0.05 (small-sample); revisit when ≥4 identities have non-null values.
- **Subjective-quality validation**: 10-min user-judgment check comparing weighted ranking to intuition. Run after a few real tasks accumulate.

## Phase H.7.1 — Asymmetric-challenger callsite wiring — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped via the corrected autonomous-platform pattern (root delegated to architect + 13-node-backend; never hand-coded). Closes the H.2.3 + H.2.4 callsite gap unmoved across CS-1/CS-2/CS-3 chaos runs (architect's "substrate-rich, call-site-poor" finding).

### What landed
- `commands/build-team.md` Step 7 — literal ~93-line bash flow with three branches per `recommend-verification`'s `verification` field
- `agent-identity.js` — new `cmdAssignPair` subcommand (lines 436-525) with internal exclusion accumulation
- `pattern-recorder.js` + `agent-identity.js` — `--paired-with` + `--convergence` flags compose into `quality_factors` payload; new `convergence_agree_pct` + `convergence_samples` aggregate axes
- `patterns/asymmetric-challenger.md` + `patterns/trust-tiered-verification.md` — status `active` → `active+enforced` with new "Enforcement callsite" sections
- `patterns/README.md` — legend defines new status; table updated
- `contracts-validate.js` — `VALID_STATUSES` extended (noor's inline capability-gap fix)

### Cycle data
- ari (04-architect): pass=3, passRate=1.0, convergence_agree_pct=1.0
- noor (13-node-backend): pass=2, passRate=1.0, convergence_agree_pct=1.0
- Toolkit-wide builder verdicts: 7 → 9 (+2 paired)
- First convergence-axis entries in toolkit history

### H.7.1 follow-ups (deferred)
- **Real /build-team self-test**: smoke-test validated assign-pair + recording. A real /build-team invocation that triggers the FULL Step 7 flow (recommend-verification → assign-challenger → spawn implementer + challenger → verify both → record convergence) is the next step. Suggested next-task: M-1 spawn-conventions update from H.6.9 backlog.
- **`validation_sources` for challenger.contract.json**: should challenger output cite primary references too? Probably yes for security-themed pair-runs (RFCs); deferred until pattern emerges.
- **Token-extraction validation**: H.7.1 verdicts had `tokensUsed: null` (no transcripts); future spawns with `--transcript` should populate it.
- **`assign-pair` semantic clarification**: noor's implementation prefers different-persona (matches asymmetric-challenger), which means the "symmetric-pair" branch in build-team Step 7 also gets different-persona challengers. If true symmetric-pair (same-persona-different-identity) is needed for the `low-trust + unproven` policy, future phase to add explicit `--same-persona` flag.

## Phase H.7.0-prep — Hybrid quality factors + validation_sources registry — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. The observability layer for the eventual H.7.0 evolution loop. Two coordinated, schema-additive changes — both forward-compat, neither changes `tierOf` (H.4.2 audit transparency preserved).

### A. Hybrid quality factors

`quality_factors_history` array on each identity captures 5 axes per verdict:
- `findings_per_10k` (efficiency)
- `file_citations_per_finding` (depth-of-evidence)
- `cap_request_actionability` (diagnostic instinct — acted/total)
- `kb_provenance_verified` (F9 transcript-validated)
- `tokens` (raw cost signal)

Bounded at 50 most-recent entries per identity. Backwards-compat: missing flags = null axes.

`pattern-recorder.js` extended with `--tokens / --file-citations / --cap-requests-acted / --cap-requests-total / --kb-provenance-verified` flags. Composes payload, forwards as `--quality-factors-json` to `agent-identity.js`.

`contract-verifier.js` summary block extended with `tokensUsed` (computed from `--transcript` JSONL when supplied; null otherwise).

New `quality-factors-backfill.js` — idempotent one-shot. Reads spawn-history.jsonl + agent-patterns.json fallback. Backfilled 5 H.6.x identities (kira, casey, hugo, vlad, niko).

### B. validation_sources registry

`kb:hets/canonical-skill-sources` schema extended with optional `validation_sources: [{ title, url, type, year }]` for skill classes where owner docs aren't enough.

Selectively populated for 4 skills:
- `penetration-testing` — RFC 6749 + RFC 6819 + OAuth Security BCP + NIST SP 800-63B
- `security-audit` — OWASP ASVS + CWE Top 25
- `pytorch` — Adam (Kingma+Ba 2014) + Attention (Vaswani+ 2017) + ResNet (He+ 2015)
- `kubernetes` — Borg (Verma+ 2015) + Borg/Omega/Kubernetes (Burns+ 2016) + Raft (Ongaro+Ousterhout 2014)

`skills/skill-forge/SKILL.md` Step 2a extended with the **two-axis principle**: canonical URL = HOW; validation_sources = WHY. Library/tooling skills correctly excluded (owner docs sufficient).

### Self-test result

Spawned `12-security-engineer.mio` on JWT-pinning audit. Verdict PASS (5 findings, 15 citations). Every finding cited BOTH OWASP (HOW) AND ≥1 RFC/NIST (WHY). `aggregate_quality_factors` populated correctly (samples=2, findings_per_10k=0.876, file_citations_per_finding=3.0, tokens=57100). Tier `unproven` (3<5 verdicts) — `tierOf` formula working as designed.

### H.7.0-prep follow-ups (deferred)

- **Empirical weight derivation (H.7.0 main)**: at ≥20 verdicts, analyze quality_factors_history correlations with subjective quality (user judgment), then design weighted formula. Today: 7 verdicts; need 13 more.
- **Token-extraction validation**: future spawn with `--transcript` should populate `tokensUsed` non-null; deferred until first such orchestration run.
- **kb_provenance_verified true-positive demo**: this self-test recorded false (no transcript); deferred until transcript-wired spawn happens.

## Phase H.6.9 — full post-H.6.7 orchestration test cycle (5 tasks, 5 PASS) — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. Closes the original H.6.1 5-task plan end-to-end. Builds on H.6.8 (Task 1: rate-limiting PASS) with 4 additional task runs across diverse domains.

| # | Task | Persona / Identity | Skill forged | Findings | Citations |
|---|------|--------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| 2 | React search-results-with-pagination | 09-react-frontend.casey | `react` (react.dev) | 9 | 34 |
| 3 | k8s Deployment + Service manifest | 10-devops-sre.hugo | `kubernetes` (kubernetes.io) | 7 | 20 |
| 4 | OAuth2 token-handling audit | 12-security-engineer.vlad | `penetration-testing` (owasp.org WSTG) | 13 | 23 |
| 5 | ETL pipeline CSV→Postgres dedup | 11-data-engineer.niko | `airflow` (airflow.apache.org) | 11 | 20 |

5 of 5 builder personas now have first real-task verdicts. Trust-formula data: kira passRate 0.667 (medium-trust), casey passRate 1.0 (still unproven at 3 verdicts under 5-threshold), hugo/vlad/niko each at 1 pass. Combined with mio's H.5.6, **6 builder verdicts toolkit-wide** — 30% of the way to H.7.0's ≥20-verdict threshold.

**Registry extension acted on this cycle**: `airflow` added to `kb:hets/canonical-skill-sources` (now 24 entries) per niko's H.6.5 `extend-canonical-sources` request. Demonstrates the H.6.5 pattern in production (sub-agent diagnoses; root acts).

**8 H.6.5 capability requests surfaced**:
- forge-skill: `express`, `postgres-engineering`, `react-testing`, `external-secrets-operator` — DEFERRED (no current blocker)
- author-kb-doc: `backend-dev/redis-pool-patterns`, `web-dev/accessibility-pagination`, `infra-dev/prometheus-patterns` — LOGGED
- extend-canonical-sources: `airflow` — ACTED ON

**Meta-findings (6)**:
- M-1: severity-section findings placement is the convention; `## Findings` heading is the trap (`kb:hets/spawn-conventions` update needed)
- M-2: spawn prompts must use absolute paths for output (cwd-relative is fragile across spawn sessions)
- M-3: root-authoring-skills (~5K tokens each) is structurally cheaper than sub-agent forge (~25-35K tokens each); H.6.5 + H.6.7 conventions validated
- M-4: H.6.2-H.6.7 substrate fixes are durable (zero routing failures across 5 diverse tasks)
- M-5: H.5.7 (builder-engineering-task contract template) promoted to HIGH priority — 4/5 tasks contorted engineering work into audit-shape
- M-6: foreground-spawn 5/5 — CS-1/CS-3's background-spawn loss pattern fully avoided

The H.6.x cycle (H.6.0 → H.6.9) is now CLOSED. Aggregate findings doc at `swarm/H.6.9-orchestration-cycle-findings.md`.

**H.6.9 follow-ups (deferred)**:
- Update `kb:hets/spawn-conventions` re: severity-section finding placement (M-1)
- Author 7 logged capability gaps (4 forge-skill, 3 author-kb-doc) when first concrete task surfaces blocker
- ~~Promote H.5.7 (builder-engineering-task contract template) — 4/5 cycle tasks hit it; not blocking but real~~ — **RESOLVED by H.5.7**
- Run a second cycle on diverse user tasks to accumulate verdicts toward H.7.0's 20-verdict threshold

## Phase H.6.8 — first post-H.6.7 orchestration test (H.6.1 closure) — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. Re-ran H.6.1's aborted task end-to-end after H.6.2-H.6.7 substrate fixes. `13-node-backend.kira` PASSED across all 9 functional + 5 antiPattern checks (6 findings, 33 file citations, recommendation `accept`). Authored `node-backend-development` skill at root from `nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/` (H.6.7 canonical-source path); updated contract `skill_status: not-yet-authored → available`; spawned in foreground; verified independently via contract-verifier; recorded verdict to identity (kira: passRate 0.6 → 0.667, tier stays medium-trust).

**3 capability gaps surfaced** (H.6.5 missing-capability-signal):
- forge-skill `express` (KB sufficient for current task; revisit on first Express-feature build)
- forge-skill `postgres-engineering` (no DB writes in this task; revisit when query/pool work surfaces)
- author-kb-doc `backend-dev/redis-pool-patterns` (Redis client lifecycle relevant to this task; agent inferred design without ground to cite — ~1 hr authoring)

All 3 deferred to backlog, not blocking.

**Meta-finding** (small-fix candidate): agent's first-pass had findings under generic `## Findings`; verifier's `minFindings` counts entries under severity sections (`## HIGH`, etc.). Update `kb:hets/spawn-conventions` to be explicit about counting location.

**Tasks 2-5 (queued next)**:
| # | Task | Persona | Forge needed |
|---|------|---------|--------------|
| 2 | "Build a search-results-with-pagination component for our React app" | 09-react-frontend | `react` (canonical: react.dev/reference) |
| 3 | "Author a Kubernetes Deployment + Service manifest for our Node API" | 10-devops-sre | `kubernetes` (canonical: kubernetes.io/docs/home/) |
| 4 | "Audit our auth flow for OAuth2 token-handling vulnerabilities" | 12-security-engineer | reuse mio's `security-audit` (no forge) |
| 5 | "Build an ETL pipeline that ingests CSV uploads into Postgres with dedup" | 11-data-engineer | `postgres-engineering` (no canonical-source entry — generic fallback) |

Each ~7 min wallclock + ~80K tokens; sequential execution to avoid background-spawn loss (CS-1 / CS-3 lessons).

## Phase H.7.0 — evolution loop (DEFERRED — needs population data)

**Status**: deferred. Design constraints documented; implementation gated on data accumulation.

**The vision**: complete the user's chicken-breeding analogy. After enough iterations, the per-persona roster collapses to **high-trust specialists tuned to the user's actual workload** via selection → reproduction → culling. L1 (H.6.6) ships the substrate primitives (soft-retire + specialist-tag + L3-forward schema with `parent`/`generation`/`traits`); H.7.0 is the breeding mechanism that USES those primitives.

**Why deferred**: today there is exactly **n=1 real builder verdict** in the system (12-security-engineer.mio's H.5.6 dogfood PASS). Designing breeding rules — what specializations propagate, what thresholds gate reproduction, how parent traits map to kid priors — requires population-level data. Designing from n=1 produces guesswork rules that get re-tuned later anyway. **L1 + L2 are the substrate that the population accumulates *into*; H.7.0 lands when the data exists to design it empirically (target: ≥20 builder verdicts).**

**Scope (when triggered)**:
- New `agent-identity breed --persona X` subcommand — picks a high-trust parent within the persona, spawns a kid identity with `parent: <parent-id>`, `generation: parent.generation + 1`, empty verdict record (kid starts as `unproven`), inherits `traits` from parent as priors (skill focus + kb focus)
- Specialization-aware `assign` — when picking from roster, prefer identities whose `specializations[]` overlap `task.tags`. Falls back to round-robin across non-specialists when no match.
- Diversity guard — at least 1 round-robin generalist per persona must remain un-bred (avoid monoculture; the breeding-only mode would over-fit to the workload that *was* but not what *will be*)
- Population cap — retire offsets breed (don't grow roster unboundedly)
- User-gate on first breed per persona (per skill-bootstrapping convention) — opt-in, not silent

**Pre-design constraints (locked in H.6.6 to ensure forward-compat)**:
- Lineage tracked: `parent: identity-id` + `generation: int` (already in schema)
- Inheritance shape: `traits` field already in schema (`{ skillFocus, kbFocus, taskDomain }`)
- Soft-retire: kept (don't hard-delete; keep audit trail)
- Triggers: manual `breed --persona X` first; automated periodic later (with user-gate)

**Estimate**: ~150-200 LoC + ~3-4hr design + integration. Won't start until ≥20 verdicts accumulate.

## Phase H.6.7 — canonical-source registry (L2 of evolution loop) — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. New KB doc `kb:hets/canonical-skill-sources` (23 entries across 6 domains) + skill-forge step 2a "canonical-source lookup" + skill-bootstrapping pattern updated. Skill-forge now consults the registry FIRST; generic internet research is the fallback when no canonical source exists.

**What landed**:
- 23 canonical-source entries: web/frontend (5), backend (6), mobile (3), data/ML (4), infra/devops (3), security (2)
- Each entry has `url` + `type` (`reference` > `book` > `getting-started` > `spec`) + `notes` (version pinning, framing nuances)
- KB doc registered + resolves at `kb:hets/canonical-skill-sources@106baa33`
- skill-forge SKILL.md step 2a documents the lookup + canonical-first rationale
- skill-bootstrapping pattern's failure mode #2 (low-quality bootstrap) and #3 (licensing risk) explicitly note the H.6.7 reduction
- New failure mode #5 (stale URLs) acknowledged with version-pinning + quarterly audit counter

**H.6.7 follow-ups (deferred)**:
- **Quarterly URL audit** — projects relocate docs (React did; Node did). A `kb-resolver scan` extension that follows registry URLs and flags 404s would automate the audit. ~50 LoC + ~1 hr.
- **Skill-forge canonical-source enforcement test** — when a skill IS in the registry, validate that the forged scaffold cites the canonical URL. Useful E2E probe. ~30 LoC.
- **Auto-extend convention** — sub-agent forging a skill that SHOULD have had a canonical source emits `request: { type: extend-canonical-sources }` via missing-capability-signal. Schema reserved (extend-canonical-sources is the proposed type); wire-up follows when the first such request appears in the wild.

## Phase H.6.6 — lifecycle primitives + L3-forward schema — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. Closes user's chicken-breeding-analogy vision at the L1 (lifecycle primitives) layer. Two new `agent-identity` subcommands (`prune`, `unretire`) + schema additions (`retired`, `parent`, `generation`, `traits`) + `_backfillH66Schema` for legacy records + retired-skip in `cmdAssign` round-robin.

The toolkit can now soft-retire underperforming identities (verdicts ≥ 10, passRate < 0.3) + tag specialists (verdicts ≥ 5, passRate ≥ 0.8, ≥3 invocations of one skill). Schema is L3-forward: `parent` and `generation` ride along blind today (null + 0); when H.7.0 ships breeding, prior identity data is already shape-compatible — no migration.

**H.6.6 follow-ups (deferred)**:
- **Specialization-aware assign** — today `assign` is round-robin; H.7.0 wants specialization × task-tag matching. Substrate exists (specialiations[] + traits); routing logic is the H.7.0 work.
- **`prune` periodic schedule** — today manual; could become a Stop-hook trigger every N turns. Defer until at least one real prune happens manually + pattern proves out.
- **Decay specializations over time** — pattern doc's failure mode #2 ("stale specializations"): auto-derived tags persist after focus shifts. Option: require ≥3 recent runs in category to keep tag. Not load-bearing today (n=1 specialist).

## Phase H.6.5 — missing-capability-signal pattern (autonomous platform extension) — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. Closes the meta-finding from post-H.6.4 conversation: *"the orchestrator should be authoring personas, not the user hand-writing them."*

The toolkit can now grow its own substrate (personas, skills, KB docs, stack-map entries) on demand — gated by user approval. **Convention, not new code**: sub-agents diagnose; root acquires. New pattern doc + spawn-conventions schema + architect persona update + build-team workflow extension.

The deeper framing: this is the toolkit's commitment to **autonomous platform** rather than just **marketplace plugin**. Anyone using the plugin can grow it to fit their stack without needing hand-authoring expertise.

**H.6.5 follow-ups (deferred)**:
- **14-python-backend** persona — would now be triggered by the convention next time someone runs a Python-backend task; the architect would emit `request: forge-persona` and root would author it via the H.6.5 flow. No code work needed; just a future test scenario.
- **post-task review hook** — automated check that sub-agents didn't write substrate files (would catch convention violations). ~30 LoC linter scanning the sub-agent's tool-use record. Not load-bearing yet (we trust the convention); could ship when the toolkit gets adopted by external users who haven't internalized the pattern.

## Phase H.6.3 — skill-forge auto-warn at assign-time — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. Closes the last H.6.1 gap. `agent-identity assign --persona X` now surfaces a `forgeNeeded` field (split into required-blockers and recommended-advisory) at the JSON output, plus a human-readable `warning` field when blockers exist. Optional `--require-forged` flag exits non-zero on blockers — for pipelines that want a hard gate.

The forge→assign→spawn flow is now explicit (see `patterns/skill-bootstrapping.md` for the 3-step pattern).

**Note**: this is a WARN, not an AUTO-FIX. The toolkit doesn't auto-invoke `/forge` (deliberate — forging is high-risk + needs user gate per the existing skill-bootstrapping pattern). What's automated: surfacing the gap to the orchestrator at assign-time so they can act on it explicitly.

## Phase H.6.2 + H.6.4 — Node/Express routing coherence — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. Closes the load-bearing routing-coherence gap from H.6.1 (Express tasks couldn't be coherently routed). New `13-node-backend` persona with Node-specific contract + KB scope + identity roster; stack-skill-map extended with Backend — Node entry; 2 new KB docs (`node-runtime-basics`, `express-essentials`); re-run of H.6.1 task-1 routing walkthrough now succeeds.

**Open follow-ups**:
- **H.6.3** — auto-trigger skill-forge from `agent-identity assign` when contract has `not-yet-authored` skills (the only remaining gap from H.6.1; ~50 LoC, queued next)
- **14-python-backend** persona — same gap shape as 13-node-backend, lower urgency (Backend — Python entry still routes to 07-java-backend as placeholder)

## Phase H.6.1 — first abstract-task orchestration walkthrough — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. Validated the spawn-recorder + the manual orchestration walkthrough discipline. Surfaced 4 follow-up phases (H.6.2, H.6.3, H.6.4) plus confirmed H.5.7 priority. See `swarm/H.6.1-orchestration-test-findings.md` for the full report.

## Phase H.6.0 — spawn-recorder for orchestration-test visibility — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. Foundational tooling for H.6.x orchestration tests. New `scripts/agent-team/spawn-recorder.js` captures per-spawn audit data (persona, identity, skills resolved, kb_scope read/declared, verdict, tokens, wallclock, gaps surfaced) into `~/.claude/spawn-history.jsonl`.

The `gaps` aggregator is the load-bearing subcommand — surfaces recurring orchestration gaps across multi-run test batches (e.g., "skill-forge not auto-triggered" recurring across multiple tasks).

**H.6.x follow-ups**:
- **H.6.1** — first abstract-task orchestration test ("Add rate limiting to my Express API") — captures what gets invoked vs what we expected
- **H.6.2** — batch 4 more orchestration tests across diverse domains (security, devops, data, frontend)
- **H.6.3** — analyze recurring gaps; decide which to fix as code (e.g., auto-trigger forge), which to fix as docs (e.g., disambiguate task → persona routing rules)

## Phase H.5.7 — builder contract shape — SHIPPED (see top of BACKLOG)

**Status**: shipped. Original surfacing context preserved below for historical reference. See "Phase H.5.7 — Engineering-task contract template — SHIPPED" at the top of this file for what landed.

**Original H.5.6 H-1 finding** (preserved): the 12-security-engineer contract (and presumably the other 6 builder contracts 06-11 by symmetry) is shaped for audit-report output: `minFindings ≥ 2`, `hasFileCitations ≥ 4`, `hasSeveritySections [CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW]`, `containsKeywords ["threat"]`, audit-domain `kb_scope`. This works for chaos-test runs where builders simulate adversarial audits. It does NOT work for builders running real engineering tasks.

**Resolution chosen**: Option 1 (separate contract template) — `engineering-task.contract.json` is the shared generic template (mirroring `challenger.contract.json`'s shape), selected at spawn time by the build-team Step 7 task-type heuristic. Option 2 (conditional checks per task_type) was rejected as more complex without proportional benefit.

## Phase H.5.6 — first builder dogfood — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. Closes CS-3 architect-theo's last architectural HIGH (builders 06-12 at unproven tier with no real verdicts).

What landed:
- `12-security-engineer.mio` spawned on the auditor-kb_scope-authoring task (real engineering work, not a fixture)
- 5 auditor contracts (01-05) now have `kb_scope.default` + opt into `kb_scope_consumed` check
- contract-verifier verdict: **PASS** across all 9 functional + 5 antiPattern checks
- mio's identity record updated: passRate=1.0, verdicts.pass=1, skillInvocations.security-audit=1
- **First-ever builder verdict recorded** — real trust-formula data populated
- mio surfaced a genuine architectural H-1 finding (contract shape mismatch) — promoted to H.5.7 backlog item

H.4.0's enforcement template now applies symmetrically: producers (builders 06-12) AND consumers (auditors 01-05) all opt into `kb_scope_consumed`.

## Phase H.5.5 — architectural cleanup — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. Closes 2 of theo's 3 architectural HIGHs from CS-3:

1. **`hierarchical-aggregate.js` location DECIDED** — 5 consecutive chaos runs flagged "either move or document." H.5.5 commits to the decision: stays at `swarm/` because it's chaos-test runtime tooling (operates over `swarm/run-state/` artifacts; only invoked by chaos-test workflows), not HETS substrate (which is what `scripts/agent-team/` houses — substrate consumed by spawned actors + verifier callsites). SKILL.md:122 reframed from "persistent BACKLOG item to relocate" to explicit decision rationale.

2. **`_lib/` directory of one resolved** — created `scripts/agent-team/_lib/runState.js` consolidating `RUN_STATE_BASE` constant + `runStateDir(runId)` helper that was previously duplicated in tree-tracker.js, budget-tracker.js, and kb-resolver.js. `_lib/` now has 2 modules (lock.js + runState.js) — coherent abstraction, not premature directory naming. E2E validated all 3 consumers + env override.

**The 3rd architectural HIGH (builder dogfood) deferred to H.5.6** since it requires a real engineering task + spawn cycle + verdict capture — not refactor work.

## Phase H.5.4 — remaining CS-3 HIGH cluster — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. Closes the last 4 of the actionable CS-3 HIGH findings (architectural HIGHs from theo deferred to H.5.5/H.5.6 since they need different scope decisions).

What landed:
- New `hooks/scripts/_lib/file-path-pattern.js` (shared filePath extractor); de-duped + extended for Windows + quoted-paths-with-spaces (blair H-4)
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` verification in `session-reset.js` (kai H-4)
- README: explicit marketplace.json layout note (rafael HIGH-1)
- README: removed "legacy" / "deprecated" framings around install.sh (rafael HIGH-2)

E2E validated 5 probes. contracts-validate: 0 violations.

**Architectural HIGHs from theo (deferred — need scope decisions, not pure fixes)**:
- `hierarchical-aggregate.js` location drift (5 chaos runs unmoved) — decide: relocate or document. Either way ~10 min.
- `_lib/` directory of one — extract `_lib/runState.js` from the 4 scripts that resolve `swarm/run-state/` paths; ~30 min refactor.

**Remaining CS-3 MEDIUM/LOW** (not addressed in this phase; deferred to next chaos cycle to see if they re-surface):
- `inferKindFromSignal` default-allow (kai M-1)
- Frontmatter validator: no YAML parse (blair M-2 / kai M-2)
- parseFrontmatter strip-quotes permissive (kai M-3)
- `newCandidateId` 24-bit collision risk (kai L-1) — partially closed by H.5.3 tmp-suffix fix
- scanContent regex stateful-ness brittle (kai L-2)

## Phase H.5.3 — self-improve-store hardening + frontmatter BOM — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. Closes 6 CS-3 HIGH findings clustered around `scripts/self-improve-store.js` robustness + 1 frontmatter validator cross-platform issue.

What landed:
- `writeAtomic` tmp-suffix: pid + hrtime + 6-byte crypto nonce (was just pid; collided under concurrent same-PID writers)
- Lock-fallback now emits stderr warning on first occurrence (was silently no-op)
- `loadCounters` + `loadPending` quarantine corrupt files to `<path>.corrupt-<ISO>` before returning defaults (was silently zeroing history on parse failure)
- `executeGraduation` wraps observations.log appends in `withLock` + caps line length at 256 bytes (safely under Darwin's 512-byte PIPE_BUF)
- `hasFrontmatter` strips UTF-8 BOM (`﻿`) before frontmatter check (was false-blocking valid skills written from BOM-injecting editors)

E2E validated 5 probes. ~/.claude/ sync verified. contracts-validate: 0 violations.

**Remaining HIGHs from CS-3 (deferred to H.5.4):**
- `auto-store-enrichment.js` filePath regex: Windows + spaces + regex metacharacters (blair H-4)
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` placeholder unverified at runtime (kai H-4)
- README marketplace.json location framing (rafael HIGH-1)
- README install.sh deprecation status (rafael HIGH-2)
- `extractKbReadsFromTranscript` path-traversal regex normalization (kai H-3) — partially addressed in H.5.2
- `hierarchical-aggregate.js` location drift (theo HIGH; 5 chaos runs unmoved)
- Builders 06-12 unproven tier (theo HIGH; H.5.4 dogfood territory)
- `_lib/` directory of one (theo HIGH; refactor)

## Phase H.5.2 — CS-3 CRIT bundle — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. All 5 CRITICAL findings from the CS-3 chaos-test (chaos-20260505-095622-cs3) auditor swarm closed in one PR.

What landed:
- **`kb_scope_consumed` provenance hardening** (`contract-verifier.js:109-180`) — text-pattern check became real provenance check via tool_use ↔ tool_result pairing + shell-evasion rejection + result-content validation. Closes hacker.kai CRIT-1 ("verifier was upgraded from no-enforcement to string-pattern-enforcement that any actor controlling its own transcript can pass").
- **Secrets validator hardening** (`hooks/scripts/validators/validate-no-bare-secrets.js`):
  - Added `github_pat_<82chars>` regex (modern fine-grained PAT, missing since shipping)
  - Fail-CLOSED on parse error (was fail-open — wrong for a security gate)
  - Tightened SKIP_PATH_PATTERNS (validator dir was self-permissive)
  - Fixed Edit field reference (`replace_all_string` doesn't exist; was effectively only scanning `new_string`)
  - Added multi-edit fallback + NotebookEdit pessimistic scan
- **README hook count consistency** — 5 sections updated from inconsistent `11`/`(6)`/`6 hook scripts` to canonical `11`. Section preamble explains breakdown by lifecycle event.
- **README single-canonical Install** — second `## Install` heading renamed to `## Legacy installer reference`; plugin-route note added that `hooks/hooks.json` auto-loads via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (no manual `settings.json` merge needed).

E2E validated 9 probes (4 secrets, 2 kb_scope provenance, 3 Edit shape). contracts-validate: 0 violations across all 7 validators.

**H.5.x follow-ups still in BACKLOG**:
- **H.5.3** — pattern→enforcement bridge (12 of 13 patterns at 0 contract refs; persistent finding for 3 consecutive runs)
- **H.5.4** — builder dogfood run (architect.theo recommends elevating above H.5.3)
- **`hierarchical-aggregate.js` relocation** — 5 consecutive chaos runs unmoved; either relocate or document why `swarm/` is correct
- **`_lib/` second extraction** — directory of one (just `lock.js`); CS-2 recommended `_lib/runState.js` consolidation
- **Pre-spawn budget-tracker check** — substrate exists, call-site missing
- **Auditor contracts (01-05) lack `kb_scope`** — uniformly applies H.4.0 enforcement to consumers, not just producers

## Phase H.5.1 — pattern status sync + KB exemption doc — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. Closes 2 of CS-3 Track 1's findings:

1. **Pattern status drift** — 9 pattern docs were stuck at `status: implementing` despite their underlying code shipping phases ago. Promoted to `active` across all 3 sources of truth (frontmatter, `patterns/README.md` index, `SKILL.md` table). Pattern table also fills in the previously-missing `kb-scope-enforcement` row (13th pattern, shipped H.4.0). Final distribution: 12 active, 1 observed, 0 implementing.
2. **"Orphan" KB framing was wrong** — CS-3 Track 1 flagged 3 KB docs as missing from contract `kb_scope.default`. Investigation showed they're consumed by skills/commands/manifests, just not by per-persona contracts. Documented as intentional exemption in `patterns/kb-scope-enforcement.md` under a new "Toolkit-meta KB docs are intentionally exempt" section. The `kb_scope_consumed` check's principle is now explicit: domain-knowledge enforcement only, not toolkit-shared doc enforcement.

contracts-validate: 0 violations across all 7 validators after sync.

**H.5.1 follow-ups (deferred)**:

- **CS-3 Track 2 — full auditor swarm**: 5 personas in parallel for qualitative bug-hunt findings on top of the coverage audit. ~5-10 min wallclock, ~50-80K tokens. Defer until H.5.2/H.5.3 land so auditors don't waste effort on already-known findings.
- **H.5.3 — pattern → enforcement bridge**: 12 of 13 patterns have 0 contract refs. For each unenforced pattern: ship a verifier check (like H.4.0 did for `kb_scope`), promote if naturally enforced via existing mechanisms, or demote if aspirational. Big phase; needs explicit per-pattern triage.
- **H.5.4 — builder dogfood run**: builders 06-12 are at `unproven` tier with no real verdicts. Spawn 1-2 on a real task to validate the substrate works end-to-end. Generates real trust-formula data.

## Phase H.5.0 — official Claude Code plugin packaging — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. Toolkit is now installable as an official Claude Code plugin via `/plugin marketplace add shashankcm95/claude-skills-consolidated`. Three new manifests at repo root (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `hooks/hooks.json`, `marketplace.json`) match the `code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference` schema. Anti-AI-slop differentiation table in README explicitly compares this plugin's enforcement footprint (11 hooks, multi-agent HETS, triple-contract verifier, threshold-based auto self-improve, chaos-test meta-validation, 13 patterns) against typical SKILL.md-template plugins.

**H.5.x follow-ups (not yet scoped)**:
- **H.5.1 — official marketplace submission**: submit via `https://platform.claude.com/plugins/submit` once we've stress-tested the plugin install path with at least one external user. Anthropic review process (safety + quality gate); not publicly documented.
- **Multi-plugin marketplace split**: today the marketplace.json lists one plugin. If specific components grow independent uptake (HETS standalone, prompt-enrichment standalone, validators standalone), revisit splitting into separate plugin entries within the same marketplace.
- **Deprecate `install.sh`?**: keep as fallback for now; reassess after H.5.1 if plugin-path adoption reaches 80%+ of installs.

## Phase H.4.2 — validator hooks + trust formula transparency — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. Two hook-layer validators + one pattern-doc clarification, deferred from the original H.4.1 scope so H.4.1 could ship the auto self-improve loop in isolation.

What landed:
- **`hooks/scripts/validators/validate-no-bare-secrets.js`** (PreToolUse:Edit/Write)
  - Blocks writes containing secret-shaped literals
  - Patterns: Anthropic API keys, Stripe live + restricted keys, Slack tokens, GitHub PATs, AWS access key IDs, JWT-shape tokens, `*_(SECRET|KEY|TOKEN|PASSWORD)=<value>` assignments
  - Skip list: `.env.example`, `.env.template`, `tests/fixtures/`, the validator's own dir
  - Placeholder detection: `${VAR}`, `<NAME>`, `{{template}}`, repeat-char sequences, common placeholder strings
  - **Never echoes matched literals** in block reasons (log/chat hygiene)
- **`hooks/scripts/validators/validate-frontmatter-on-skills.js`** (PreToolUse:Write)
  - Blocks Write of skill / pattern .md files missing YAML frontmatter
  - Path patterns: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, `skills/<name>/<file>.md`, `skills/agent-team/patterns/<file>.md`
  - Skip basenames: README.md, BACKLOG.md, CHANGELOG.md
- **`patterns/agent-identity-reputation.md` Trust Formula section**
  - Documents the actual `tierOf()` from `agent-identity.js:97-104`
  - Worked examples with live identity data
  - Tier → policy mapping table
  - Known limitations: no recency decay, partial counts as miss, cliff thresholds
  - Comparison to ruflo's published `0.4·success + 0.2·uptime + 0.2·threat + 0.2·integrity`

E2E validated 8 probes (4 secrets, 4 frontmatter). Sync to `~/.claude/` parity verified. contracts-validate 0 violations.

**H.4.2 follow-ups**:
- `validators-config.json` external-pattern file (matches config-guard's pattern) — for now patterns are inlined; revisit when a 3rd validator lands
- Trust-formula tunables (partial-credit weight, recency window, MIN_VERDICTS_FOR_TIER per-persona override) — surfaced in pattern doc but not implemented

## Phase H.4 — kb_scope enforcement — SHIPPED as H.4.0

**Status**: shipped. Closes the #1 unmoved finding from both CS-1 and CS-2 architects: `kb_scope` was loaded into spawn-time prompt blocks but never enforced at verify-time. Same shape as H.2.6's `invokesRequiredSkills` precedent — contract field → transcript scan → pass/fail.

What landed:
- New `kb_scope_consumed` functional check in `contract-verifier.js` + `extractKbReadsFromTranscript` helper
- Detects 3 KB-read invocation shapes (Bash `kb-resolver cat`, Bash `kb-resolver resolve kb:<id>`, Read of `kb/<id>.md`); hash-pinned refs strip `@hash` for matching
- Rich result: `{pass, source, declared, consumed, kbReadsObserved, missingKbScope}`
- 8 contracts opted in at `required: true`: 7 builders (06-12) F9, challenger F6
- Graceful pass semantics for no-transcript / no-scope-declared (matches `invokesRequiredSkills`)
- New pattern doc `patterns/kb-scope-enforcement.md` (status: `active`)
- 5 E2E probes pass; contracts-validate 0 violations

**H.4.x follow-ups (not yet scoped)**:
- Apply the same template to other "declared but unenforced" contract fields if any surface (challenger's `_doc` field, `fallbackAcceptable` arrays — both informational today; would they benefit from enforcement?)
- Auditor contracts (01-05) currently have no `kb_scope` declared. If they should — declare + opt them in. Architect's "single source of truth" principle suggests yes.

## Phase H.3 — CS-2 regression bundle — SHIPPED as H.3.6

**Status**: shipped. 5 fixes for the 5 regressions surfaced by the second meta-validation chaos run (chaos-20260503-154327-cs2):

1. **`_lib/lock.js` self-PID deadlock** (CS-2 hacker.ren CRIT-1 + code-reviewer.jade C-1, convergent finding) — prior code's `pid !== process.pid` skip-cleanup branch deadlocked the process against its own crashed-prior-incarnation orphan until 3s timeout. Now: same-PID lock files reclaim immediately (a fresh `withLock()` call cannot legitimately be holding its own lock); also handles garbage-PID files via NaN guard.
2. **`tree-tracker.js` whole-RMW lock back-apply** (CS-2 code-reviewer.jade BLOCK) — H.3.2 fix wrapped only the WRITE in withLock, but `cmdSpawn` + `cmdComplete` do load→modify→save independently. Same race that H.3.2's own-validation probe 3 explicitly proved fatal in budget-tracker; not back-applied to tree-tracker until now. Refactored `save()` into plain `writeTreeAtomic` + `withTreeLock` helper; both callsites wrap the whole RMW. 15s timeout matches budget-tracker.
3. **`contract-verifier.js` antiPattern unknown_check** (CS-2 architect.mira HIGH, 3-line symmetry miss) — H.3.1 fixed the FUNCTIONAL path but didn't mirror to antiPattern dispatch. Symmetric fix: `severity === 'fail'` → `antiPatternFailures++`; else → `antiPatternWarns++`.
4. **`kb-resolver.js` symlink escape** (CS-2 hacker.ren CRIT-2) — H.3.2 lexical check is symlink-blind. Added `fs.realpathSync` second-pass that canonicalizes both candidate + KB_BASE then re-checks boundary.
5. **`contracts-validate.js --list-validators` human-mode parity** (CS-2 confused-user-alex MEDIUM) — `--list-validators` now respects `--json` flag; default human-readable.

E2E validated all 5 probes + kb-resolver legit-read regression check passed. Sync to `~/.claude/scripts/agent-team/` parity verified.

**Patterns surfaced for promotion**:
- **fix-class-not-instance** — when fixing a known anti-pattern, grep sibling files for the same shape. H.3.6's existence is the proof: CS-2 caught that H.3.2 fixed the RMW race in budget-tracker but didn't back-apply to immediate-adjacent tree-tracker.
- **own-validation routinely catches the bug your fix shipped with** — H.2.1 `[a-z]{1,4}`, H.2.7 closing-brace false-positive, H.2.9 case-sensitivity, H.3.2 wrap-only-write race, H.3.6 antiPattern dispatch symmetry. Codify: every script change ships with an E2E probe that exercises the change.
- **substrate-rich, call-site-poor** (architect's persistent finding) — promote to a discipline check in the patterns library: every new substrate has at least one call-site within the same phase.

## Phase H.2 (in progress)

### H.2.2 — Builder persona expansion (07-12) — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped this turn. All 6 personas + contracts + rosters + 11 KB stubs landed.

**Bonus integration**: `knowledge-work-plugins` marketplace skills referenced via new `marketplace:<plugin>` status value in contracts (alongside `available` + `not-yet-authored`). Marketplace skills used: `engineering:incident-response` (10-devops-sre), `engineering:deploy-checklist` (multi), `engineering:debug` (multi), `engineering:testing-strategy` (multi), `engineering:system-design` (07-java-backend), `engineering:code-review` (multi), `data:sql-queries` + `data:explore-data` + `data:validate-data` + `data:statistical-analysis` (08-ml-engineer, 11-data-engineer), `design:accessibility-review` + `design:ux-copy` (09-react-frontend), `engineering:standup` (10-devops-sre), `legal:compliance-check` (12-security-engineer).

**Follow-up tasks** (lighter weight than H.2.2 but worth tracking):
- **Audit auditor personas (01-05)** for marketplace integration opportunities — `04-architect` would benefit from `engineering:architecture` + `engineering:system-design`; `03-code-reviewer` from `engineering:code-review` + `engineering:debug` + `engineering:testing-strategy`. Estimate: ~30 min, low risk.
- **Author specialist KB stubs that match marketplace skills** — e.g., `kb:engineering/incident-response-playbook` could be a HETS-side companion to the marketplace skill, providing project-specific context. Lazy: only when a builder persona spawn produces a noticeable gap.
- **Verify marketplace skill invocation paths** — when `invokesRequiredSkills` ships in H.2.6, validate that namespaced names (`engineering:debug`) resolve correctly via the actor's `Skill` tool calls.

### H.2.3 — Asymmetric challenger spawning — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped. `challenger.contract.json` + `noEmptyChallengeSection` functional check + `agent-identity assign-challenger` subcommand + `kb:hets/challenger-conventions` doc + asymmetric-challenger pattern status promoted to `implementing`. E2E validated with 4 probes covering assign-challenger preference rules + verifier accept (challenges present) + verifier reject (no challenges + capitulation phrase).

**Follow-up tasks** (deferred — pick up when H.2.4 / a real chaos run uses challengers):
- **`assign-challenger --exclude-personas <list>`** to exclude multiple personas at once (current implementation excludes only one). Useful when a chaos run has spawned 3 implementers and the challenger should differ from all 3.
- **Symmetric-pair spawning** for top-of-tree (super-root) per asymmetric-challenger pattern's "When Not to Use" — currently no scaffolding for symmetric pairs. Likely lands as part of H.2.4 trust-tiered logic.
- **Challenge-vs-claim binding** in the verifier: F3 only counts headings; could optionally validate that each `### CHALLENGE-N` quotes implementer text via a regex like `\*\*Implementer claim\*\*\s*\(quoted\)`. Useful for stricter enforcement once we see what real challenger outputs look like.

### H.2.4 — Trust-tiered verification depth — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped this turn. Queryable tier API + recommend-verification policy + `--skip-checks` verifier flag + symmetric-pair convention doc + `HETS_IDENTITY_STORE` env override for testability.

**What's wired** (per `kb:hets/symmetric-pair-conventions` + agent-identity.js `VERIFICATION_POLICY` table):
- `agent-identity tier --identity X` → returns tier + passRate + totalRuns + threshold
- `agent-identity recommend-verification --identity X` → returns full policy: `{ verification, spawnChallenger, challengerCount, skipChecks, rationale }`
- `contract-verifier --skip-checks F4,A2,noTextSimilarityToPriorRun` → matches by check.id OR check.check name; records `status: 'skipped'` (not pass/fail) for audit clarity

**Follow-up tasks** (deferred to a future phase):
- **`--tier-policy` flag on chaos-test command** — opt-in per run; auto-queries `recommend-verification` for each spawned identity and applies the policy. Currently the orchestrator must call recommend-verification manually + pass `--skip-checks` accordingly. Estimate: ~50 LoC.
- **`assign-pair --count N`** as a cleaner alternative to calling `assign-challenger` twice with `--exclude-identity`. Logged in symmetric-pair-conventions as open question. Estimate: ~30 LoC.
- **Trust decay (exponential weighting of recent runs)** per pattern doc's failure mode #3 ("trust decay — old identities with stale track records over-trusted"). Estimate: ~80 LoC; needs design pass.
- **Hysteresis on tier transitions** per pattern doc's failure mode #4 ("tier flip-flop"). Estimate: ~30 LoC.

### H.2.5 — Tech-stack analyzer + skill-bootstrapping orchestrator wiring

**Status**: pattern docs shipped (`tech-stack-analyzer.md`, `skill-bootstrapping.md`), orchestrator skill not yet authored.

**Scope**: New `skills/tech-stack-analyzer/SKILL.md` orchestrator skill that:
1. Parses user task → infers required skills (using a stack→skill map at `kb:hets/stack-skill-map`)
2. Queries the catalog (`kb-resolver list`) to detect missing skills
3. Surfaces missing skills to user with options (allow internet research / proceed without / cancel)
4. On approval, chains to `/forge` → `/review` → catalog admission

**Dependencies**: H.2.2 (builder personas as the targets).

**Estimate**: ~500 LoC + ~3hr. — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped this turn. New `skills/tech-stack-analyzer/SKILL.md` (orchestrator skill, 7-step workflow with 2 user-gates) + `kb:hets/stack-skill-map` (12 stacks across 7 domains) + `/build-team` command. Patterns `tech-stack-analyzer` + `skill-bootstrapping` status `proposed → implementing`. E2E validated 6 probes covering KB resolution, skill scaffold, command existence, and skill-name cross-validation against persona contracts + marketplace.

**Follow-up tasks** (deferred — pick up when first real `/build-team` invocation surfaces gaps):
- **`/forge` internet-research mode** — current `/forge` authors locally; the skill-bootstrapping flow assumes internet research with per-claim source tracking. Estimate: ~150 LoC + design pass.
- **Stack-skill-map auto-validation in CI** — `kb-resolver scan` could grep stack-skill-map skill names against persona contracts + marketplace, warn on broken references. Estimate: ~50 LoC.
- **`tech-stack-analyzer` skill testing harness** — current E2E only validates scaffolding (KB resolves, skill exists). A real test would mock a user task → check the analyzer's plan output. Hard to write without invoking real LLM agents; defer until we run a real `/build-team` flow and capture the trace.

### H.2.6 — `invokesRequiredSkills` verifier check — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped this turn. New functional check + `--transcript <path>` flag + functional-dispatcher extension to support rich returns + persona-skills-mapping pattern promoted to `active`.

**Implementation**: `extractSkillsFromTranscript(transcriptPath)` parses each JSONL line, finds `tool_use` blocks with `name === 'Skill'`, collects skill names from `input.skill`. Returns Set. Check cross-checks against `contract.skills.required`, skips `skill_status === 'not-yet-authored'` entries (promise mode). Source preference: `--transcript` > `--skills` flag > graceful pass (`reason: 'no_skills_source_supplied'`).

E2E validated 5 probes covering all source paths + promise-mode skip + missing-transcript-file fail.

**Follow-up tasks**:
- **Auto-discover transcript path**: parent agent could pass `--transcript-from-agent-id <id>` and the verifier resolves to `~/.claude/projects/<project>/<agent-id>.output` automatically. Currently the orchestrator must construct the path. Estimate: ~30 LoC.
- **Recommended-skill warning** (not just required): if a recommended skill that IS available in the catalog isn't invoked, emit a warning (not a fail). Useful signal for "the actor could have done better". Estimate: ~40 LoC.
- **Skill-invocation count tracking**: extend the check to record HOW MANY times each skill was invoked, surface to identity store via `--forward-skills-with-counts` so trust accumulates per `(persona, skill, count)` tuple instead of per `(persona, skill)`. Useful for the H.2.4 trust-tiered policy refinement. Estimate: ~50 LoC.

## Phase H.2 — explicitly deferred (added to backlog per user direction)

### H.2.7 — Full pattern contracts (structural code review) — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped this turn. Closes the long-standing DOCUMENTATION-DEBT flag where SKILL.md described "triple contract" but only 2/3 were implemented.

**What landed**:
- New functional check `noUnrolledLoops` — scans code blocks for ≥`maxRepetitions` (default 5) identical lines after stripping syntactic boilerplate (lines <3 chars filtered, e.g., `}`, `};`, `})`)
- New functional check `noExcessiveNesting` — brace-counting depth on C-family code blocks; default `maxDepth: 4` (matches CLAUDE.md fundamentals); strips string literals + line/block comments before counting
- New pattern doc `patterns/structural-code-review.md`
- SKILL.md "triple contract" section updated to describe what's actually implemented (no more oversell)
- Pattern catalog table refreshed with current statuses for H.2.3 through H.2.7

**Bug caught & fixed during own validation**: probe 2 initially failed `noUnrolledLoops` on legitimate nested code because 6 closing `}` in a row tripped the repetition counter. Added `length >= 3` filter to skip syntactic boilerplate. Re-run confirmed F2 passes for nested code while F3 correctly catches the depth violation.

**Follow-up tasks**:
- **Add structural checks to builder persona contracts (06-12)** — currently the contracts don't reference `noUnrolledLoops` or `noExcessiveNesting`. Adding them to all 7 builder contracts is ~30 LoC across 7 files. Defer until first chaos run with builders surfaces a real "wrote code wrong" finding.
- **Indentation-based nesting check** for Python — `noExcessiveNesting` is brace-only. A separate `noExcessiveIndent` check could count leading whitespace consistency. Lower priority; catches a smaller class of bugs.
- **`functionTooLong` check** — count lines between `function ... {` and matching `}` per CLAUDE.md "<50 lines" fundamental. ~50 LoC + brace-balance tracker.
- **`noHardcodedMagicValues` check** — flag numeric literals not assigned to a constant. Heuristic; high false-positive risk. ~80 LoC + tuning.

### H.2.7 (DOCUMENTATION-DEBT FLAG, archival marker) — RESOLVED

The flag is now resolved. SKILL.md's "triple contract" section accurately describes 3/3 implemented checks. Architect actor's chaos-20260502-060039 oversell finding is closed.

### H.2.8 — On-demand budget extensions — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped this turn. `scripts/agent-team/budget-tracker.js` with 5 subcommands; per-run state in `swarm/run-state/<run-id>/budgets.json` (gitignored). Closes the architect's "budget enforcement is fictional" finding from chaos-20260502-060039 — contract budget fields (`tokens`, `extensible`, `maxExtensions`, `extensionAmount`) are now actually enforced.

**E2E validated 7 probes**: init, manual record, transcript-extract record (sums input + output + cache_creation + cache_read), extend approve, extend deny when exhausted, run-level status, per-identity status with utilization%.

**Process note**: First phase shipped using the new git workflow — branched on `feat/phase-H.2.8-budget-extensions`, PR via `gh pr create`, merged to main with tag `phase-H.2.8` at the merge commit.

**Follow-up tasks**:
- **Pre-flight allowance check before spawn**: orchestrator could call `budget-tracker status --identity X` before re-spawning a known-expensive identity to avoid mid-spawn extension churn. ~30 LoC convention update.
- **Aggregate budget across run**: cap total per-run token spend (sum of all spawns); deny extensions when run-cap is approached even if per-spawn extensions remain. Useful for cost-controlled chaos runs. ~80 LoC.
- **Auto-record from transcript at verifier time**: `contract-verifier.js` already has `--transcript`; could auto-call `budget-tracker record-from-transcript` after verification completes, removing one manual orchestrator step. ~40 LoC.

### H.2.9 — `chaos-test --pattern <name>` simulation runner — SHIPPED

**Status**: shipped this turn. `scripts/agent-team/pattern-runner.js` extracts validation scenarios from any pattern doc; `chaos-test` command updated with `--pattern <name>` workflow.

**What landed** (~210 LoC):
- 4 subcommands: `list-patterns` (status + scenario count for all 12 patterns), `extract --pattern X` (JSON output of scenarios), `summary --pattern X` (human-readable), `prompts --pattern X` (ready-to-paste actor-prompt skeletons per scenario)
- Case-insensitive header match (caught a real bug: `structural-code-review.md` uses lowercase "strategy" — initially extracted 0 scenarios; case-insensitive fix unlocked 5)
- `\Z` regex bug avoided (used `$(?![\s\S])` per the H.2-bridge fix)
- 49 total scenarios across the 12 patterns now machine-extractable
- chaos-test command's `## Pattern-targeted runs` section documents the full workflow

**E2E validated** with 5 probes: list-patterns shows all 12 with non-zero scenario counts; extract returns JSON with frontmatter + scenarios; summary is human-readable; prompts emits structured actor-prompt skeletons; not-found pattern exits 1 with clear message.

**Follow-up tasks**:
- **First real `--pattern` chaos run**: pick a pattern (e.g., asymmetric-challenger or trust-tiered-verification) and run chaos-test --pattern against it. Will likely surface issues in the prompt-skeleton design — they're heuristic. Defer until we have appetite for a full chaos-test cycle.
- **Per-scenario verdict aggregation**: pattern-runner could add a `verify --pattern X --run-id Y` subcommand that scans the run's actor outputs for verdict markers (pattern-defense-fired / pattern-silent-failure / pattern-not-applicable) and reports a per-pattern coverage score. ~80 LoC.
- **Pattern-doc lint**: companion check `--lint --pattern X` that warns when a pattern doc's `## Validation Strategy` section is missing or has fewer than N scenarios. ~30 LoC.

## Phase G + earlier — not yet fixed

### Pre-compact-save.js JSONL append non-atomicity

**Source**: chaos-20260502-060039, code-reviewer H-4.

**Scope**: Replace `fs.appendFileSync` + `fs.writeFileSync` (read-trim cycle) with a single atomic read-update-tmp-rename. Sole exception to the toolkit's tmp-rename pattern; SIGKILL during partial flush corrupts the JSONL file.

**Estimate**: ~30 LoC + ~30min.

### `noTextSimilarityToPriorRun` silently passes when no prior run

**Source**: chaos-20260502-060039, architect MEDIUM.

**Scope**: When `priorRunDir` doesn't exist, the check returns `pass: true` with reason `no_prior_run`. Should fall back to checking similarity against sibling nodes in the same run.

**Estimate**: ~50 LoC + ~30min.

### Persona ↔ contract drift validator — SHIPPED as H.3.0 (contracts-validate.js, partial closure)

**H.3.0 update**: `scripts/agent-team/contracts-validate.js` ships 7 validators covering pattern-status drift, contract skill_status validity, kb_scope ref resolution, and pattern Related bidirectionality. **Persona-text vs contract-shape drift** (the architect's original example: persona says "800-1500 words" but contract enforces 2000 chars / ~300 words) is NOT yet covered — would require parsing the persona markdown for word-count claims. Defer that specific check as a follow-up.

First production run of the H.3.0 validator surfaced 29 real drift violations:
- 4 pattern-status-readme-consistency (README still shows `proposed` for patterns whose frontmatter says `implementing`)
- 10 pattern-related asymmetric links (architect's MEDIUM finding from CS-1)
- 14 contract-skills-status-keys (auditor contracts 01-05 reference required+recommended skills but lack `skill_status` map; the map was added in H.2-bridge for builders only)
- 1 available-but-missing (12-security-engineer references `security-audit` as `available` but `skills/security-audit/SKILL.md` doesn't exist)

**Original-scope marker preserved below** — the prior persona-text-vs-contract drift check is not done; treat as a follow-up sub-task of this entry.

#### Original-scope marker

**Source**: chaos-20260502-060039, architect HIGH (#4 top-leverage change).

**Scope**: New `scripts/agent-team/contracts-validate.js` that cross-checks each persona's `.md` ↔ `.contract.json` ↔ role-template for consistency. Catches drift at lint time. Architect's example: persona says "800-1500 words" but contract enforces only 2000 chars (~300 words).

**Estimate**: ~150 LoC + ~1hr.

### Aggregator parsing fragility

**Source**: chaos-20260502-060039, orch-behavior synthesis.

**Scope**: Aggregator counts findings only when actors use the strict `## CRITICAL → ### ID` convention. confused-user (`### F1`) and honesty-auditor (`### 1.`) both had real findings counted as 0. Either enforce convention via stricter functional check OR make aggregator robust to common variations.

**Estimate**: ~150 LoC + ~1hr (option B; option A is even smaller).

## Cross-phase / integration items (chat-scan after H.2.9)

Found by scanning the H.2.x conversation history end-to-end after all 9 sub-phases shipped. These are themes that surfaced multiple times but weren't captured as concrete tasks in any phase's follow-ups. Ordered roughly by leverage.

### CS-2 — README refresh through H.2.9

**Status**: README documents through H.2.4 only.

**Scope**: Add to README the H.2.5–H.2.9 components: `tech-stack-analyzer` skill, `/build-team` command, `pattern-runner.js`, `budget-tracker.js`, `noUnrolledLoops` + `noExcessiveNesting` checks, knowledge-work-plugins integration, the `marketplace:` skill_status value. Update Project Structure to show `commands/build-team.md`, the new scripts.

**Estimate**: ~30 min, additive (no removals).

### CS-3 — MCP server exposing HETS state

**Status**: implied by Gemini conversation (MCP for connectors); never made concrete.

**Scope**: Author a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes HETS substrate operations (`assign-identity`, `recommend-verification`, `resolve kb-ref`, `extract pattern scenarios`, `record budget usage`) as MCP tools. Lets other Claude Code instances consume HETS WITHOUT cloning the toolkit — closes the cross-project-reuse promise of content-addressed refs.

**Why this matters**: today HETS is filesystem-bound. To use it from another project, you clone the toolkit + run scripts. An MCP server would make HETS a first-class shared service.

**Estimate**: ~3-4 hrs (new MCP server scaffolding + 5-7 tool handlers + auth/permission story).

### CS-5 — agent-swarm vs agent-team skill consolidation

**Status**: never resolved during phase work.

**Scope**: The original toolkit had `skills/agent-swarm/` (parallel sub-agent dispatch). H.2 added `skills/agent-team/` (full HETS — hierarchical with contracts, identity, KB, etc.). They overlap conceptually. Decide:
- (a) Merge: agent-team subsumes agent-swarm; deprecate agent-swarm
- (b) Layer: agent-swarm = lightweight parallel-dispatch; agent-team = heavyweight HETS; both kept with cross-references
- (c) Rename: agent-swarm → agent-swarm-classic; agent-team → agent-team

Option (b) is probably right (lightweight tool for simple cases, heavyweight for product work) but worth a deliberate decision rather than current accidental overlap.

**Estimate**: ~30 min (decision + cross-reference doc updates; no code unless deprecating).

### CS-6 — End-user guide for builder personas

**Status**: builder personas (06-12) ship but no walkthrough exists for end-user adoption.

**Scope**: New doc at `skills/agent-team/USING.md` (or major README section) walking through:
1. Install the toolkit
2. Initialize HETS (`agent-identity init`, `kb-resolver scan`)
3. Run `/build-team your-real-task`
4. Review the analyzer's plan; redirect if needed
5. Bootstrap any missing skills via `/forge`
6. Spawn the team; review per-actor outputs
7. Verify; iterate

Target audience: developer who clones the toolkit for a real product project (not for chaos-testing the toolkit itself).

**Estimate**: ~1 hr.

### CS-7 — Pre-flight check for chaos-test substrate

**Status**: chaos-test command assumes substrate is initialized.

**Scope**: Add a step (or a `chaos-test preflight` subcommand) that verifies before spawning:
- `kb-resolver scan` runs cleanly (manifest fresh)
- `agent-identity list` succeeds (registry initialized)
- `budget-tracker init` works for the run-id (or creates fresh budget file)
- All 5 personas in scope have valid contract files
- `pattern-runner list-patterns` returns expected count

**Estimate**: ~30 min (add to chaos-test.md as Step 0 + maybe a wrapper script).

### CS-8 — Cross-script env var consistency doc

**Status**: 5 env vars distributed across HETS scripts; per-script docstring only.

**Scope**: Single doc (e.g., `kb:hets/env-vars` or section in SKILL.md) listing all HETS env vars, their defaults, which scripts honor them:
- `HETS_KB_DIR` — kb-resolver
- `HETS_RUN_STATE_DIR` — kb-resolver, budget-tracker, tree-tracker (after H.2.1 fix)
- `HETS_IDENTITY_STORE` — agent-identity
- `HETS_CONTRACTS_DIR` — budget-tracker (could be adopted by others)
- `HETS_PATTERNS_DIR` — pattern-runner

**Estimate**: ~15 min.

### CS-9 — MemPalace integration for HETS state (optional)

**Status**: HETS state lives in local JSON files; MemPalace MCP available but unused for HETS.

**Scope**: Optional adapter layer where `agent-identities.json`, `agent-patterns.json`, and the kb manifest can route through MemPalace (when configured) for cross-session semantic memory + cross-machine sync. Local-file fallback remains the default.

**Estimate**: ~2 hrs (define interface + implement adapters; keep local as fallback per existing toolkit pattern).

### CS-10 — chaos-test --pattern as actual CLI orchestration

**Status**: chaos-test command's `## Pattern-targeted runs` section is LLM instructions; no end-to-end CLI driver.

**Scope**: Wrapper script (or `pattern-runner orchestrate --pattern X --run-id Y`) that sequences: extract scenarios → spawn one actor per scenario → wait for completion → verify each → aggregate per-pattern coverage. Removes the need for the LLM to drive the workflow turn-by-turn.

**Estimate**: ~2 hrs (parallel spawn coordination is non-trivial; needs careful state-passing).

### CS-11 — CONTRIBUTING.md retrospective examples

**Status**: CONTRIBUTING.md uses hypothetical "feat/phase-H.2.8" example; that's now historical (PR #1 shipped).

**Scope**: Update CONTRIBUTING.md examples to reference real shipped PRs (PR #1 = H.2.8 = budget-tracker; PR #2 = H.2.9 = pattern-runner). Add a "Worked examples from this repo" section.

**Estimate**: ~10 min.

### CS-12 — Compliance probe refresh for H.2.x scripts

**Status**: `compliance-probe.sh` checks prompt-enrichment + fact-force-gate; doesn't know about HETS-script usage.

**Scope**: Extend probe to additionally check for HETS substrate usage in recent runs:
- Did any run call `kb-resolver snapshot` to freeze KB state?
- Did any spawn invoke `agent-identity assign` / `assign-challenger`?
- Did contract verification call `--transcript` or rely on `--skills` fallback?
- Was `budget-tracker record-from-transcript` called post-spawn?

Useful signal for "is the HETS substrate being used or just sitting there?" — same instinct as the original probe ("is enrichment happening on real prompts?").

**Estimate**: ~1 hr.

## How to use this backlog

1. When an item becomes blocking, promote it to a phase in SKILL.md
2. When working in a related area, opportunistically pick up adjacent items (the H.2.1 vertical slice picked up tree-tracker H-2 + M-2 + path resolution + the [a-z]{1,10} regex fix all at once)
3. Re-evaluate quarterly — items here may become irrelevant as the toolkit evolves

## Discipline checks (before adding a new persona / contract / KB doc / pattern)

Asked of every new addition to defend against org-chart delusion + maintenance-tax bloat:

- **Does this earn its keep, or am I adding it because the architecture allows it?** A persona that handles ≤2 distinct task types overlaps too much with an existing one — fold in.
- **Will this be invoked?** A KB doc that no spawn prompt references is dead weight; a contract field that no verifier check reads is documentation drift.
- **Is the maintenance cost real?** Speculative skill authoring (vs promise-mode + bootstrap on first use) is the trap — only author what's about to be used.
- **Does it overlap with a native primitive?** Periodic native-primitive audit (every quarter, see "Periodic external-audit checks" below).

## Periodic external-audit checks (quarterly)

Things to revisit on a slow cadence so the toolkit doesn't accumulate redundancy with native primitives or marketplace plugins:

1. **Native Anthropic / Claude Code primitives** — has anything shipped that subsumes what we built (Skills format, Plugins format, native sub-agent coordination)? If so, evaluate migration cost vs custom-feature differentiation. Don't migrate just because it's native; do migrate if our custom layer no longer adds measurable value.
2. **MCP servers for connectors** — if/when we need Slack / DB / external integrations, use MCP servers (https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Don't roll our own connectors.
3. **`.claude-plugin/` packaging** — if we want to distribute the toolkit so others can install it, repackage as a plugin bundle. Doesn't change what we built; changes how it ships.
