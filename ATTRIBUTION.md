# Attribution

This toolkit was built from original work, informed by architectural patterns
and concepts from the following open-source projects:

## everything-claude-code (MIT License)
- **Author**: Affaan Mustafa
- **Repository**: https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code
- **What we learned from**: Hook architecture patterns (PreToolUse guards,
  PostToolUse quality gates, Stop-phase batch operations), agent delegation
  model with scoped tool access and model tier routing, config protection
  concept, continuous learning instinct extraction, rules-as-guardrails
  injection pattern.

## MemPalace (MIT License)
- **Author**: MemPalace contributors
- **Repository**: https://github.com/mempalace/mempalace
- **What we learned from**: Pre-compaction memory save hooks that preserve
  context before window compression, structured memory hierarchy
  (palace/wing/room/drawer metaphor), the principle of "hooks over prompts
  for reliability" — deterministic scripts for critical behaviors.

## MiroFish (License: see repository)
- **Author**: 666ghj and contributors
- **Repository**: https://github.com/666ghj/MiroFish
- **What we learned from**: Multi-agent swarm orchestration patterns,
  autonomous agent memory and personality systems, parallel simulation
  with independent agent contexts, knowledge graph construction for
  project understanding.

## claude-superpowers (MIT License)
- **Author**: Ivan Magda
- **Repository**: https://github.com/ivan-magda/claude-superpowers
- **What we learned from**: Clean plugin manifest structure, skill
  versioning and release workflow, marketplace integration patterns.
