# Hardening Track — Live State

## Where we are

**Master plan status: APPROVED.** **HT.0.1 SHIPPED.** **HT.0.2 SHIPPED.** **HT.0.3 SHIPPED.** **HT.0.4 SHIPPED.** **HT.0.5a SHIPPED.** Two rounds of parallel pre-approval verification on the plan plus first five audit phases complete:
- Round 1 (theo + nova on v2): 24 FLAGs surfaced (10 HIGH, 7 MEDIUM, 7 LOW); v3 absorbed all HIGH FLAGs + most MEDIUM/LOW
- Round 2 (ari + jade on v3): NEEDS-REVISION minor — 9 mechanical fixes + corrections; v3.1 absorbed all
- HT.0.1 hooks layer audit: 22 files inventoried, 5 quality bars applied, 8 active forcing-instruction markers verified in hooks layer (10 family-wide), 4 doc-staleness gaps surfaced, forbidden-phrase grep gate passed clean
- HT.0.2 substrate scripts audit: 27 files inventoried (9839 LoC; 2.81× HT.0.1 surface), 5 quality bars applied, 5 inline `parseFrontmatter` divergences post-H.8.7 mapped, subprocess invocation safety verified clean (no `execSync(string)` paths remain), kb-resolver/adr.js symlink-check parity verified (different shapes, same intent), forbidden-phrase grep gate passed clean
- HT.0.3 slash commands audit: 13 files inventoried (1089 LoC; 11% of HT.0.2 surface), 5 quality bars applied, all referenced scripts/agents/skills resolve (17+ scripts, 5 agents, 4 skills, plus install.sh + plan-template + compliance-probe), `commands/build-team.md` Step 1.5 (H.8.5) wiring intact, `commands/research.md` ↔ `commands/implement.md` (H.8.6) RPI workflow consistency verified, 5-convention path-reference inconsistency mapped, forbidden-phrase grep gate passed clean
- HT.0.4 personas + contracts audit: 33 files inventoried (2044 LoC; 21% of HT.0.2 surface), 5 quality bars applied, all 18 contract `kb_scope.default` refs resolve via kb-resolver, 13 functional + 6 antiPattern checks enumerated in contract-verifier, **`noCritiqueLanguage` antiPatternCheck unimplemented but referenced by all 3 documentary contracts (14/15/16) — H.3.6 dispatch path locks all documentary actor verdicts at `partial`**, master plan contract count off-by-one ("19" claimed, 18 actual), persona MD asymmetry for 14/15/16 surfaced per architect FLAG-2 (decision-required item for HT.0.9), forbidden-phrase grep gate passed clean **on first pass** (no rephrasing needed)
- HT.0.5a KB + pattern docs audit: 54 files inventoried (8984 LoC; 91% of HT.0.2 surface — largest planned audit phase by file count), 5 quality bars applied, all 10 architecture KB docs carry H.8.0 tier structure (`## Summary` + `## Quick Reference`) per `validate-kb-doc.js:47` spec, all 22 non-architecture KB docs use original 2-section shape per `kb/README.md` template, **bidirectional `related:` validator clean (0 violations) confirms master plan claim of H.8.6 18→0 fix holds**, **11 broken forward references in 7 architecture KB docs to 8 non-existent `kb_id` targets** (validator skips because targets don't exist), 19/20 patterns use `pattern:`+`intent:` frontmatter shape (1 outlier `plan-mode-hets-injection.md` uses `name:`+`phase:`), 13/20 patterns conform to README.md "Full doc must include" spec (7 newer patterns use specialized shapes — catalog/convention-enumeration/evolution-history), `tier_token_targets:` empirical-measurement field absent in all 10 architecture KB docs, `stack-skill-map.md:73` references non-existent `14-python-backend` persona (slot occupied by H.8.6 documentary `14-codebase-locator`), `identity-roster.md` does not list `13-node-backend` roster (lags `agent-identity.js DEFAULT_ROSTERS`), 15 follow-up items for HT.0.9, forbidden-phrase grep gate passed clean **on first pass** (second consecutive phase to do so)
- HT.0.5b SKILL.md + standalone skill packages audit: 17 SKILL.md files inventoried (2087 LoC; 333 LoC agent-team SKILL.md + 1754 LoC across 16 standalone packages), 5 quality bars applied, **master plan + HT-state.md "41-phase ledger" claim stale by 20 entries — actual count 61 phase entries in `skills/agent-team/SKILL.md:248-310`**, **~14 phase numbers (H.5.1-H.5.5, H.6.0-H.6.8, H.7.1-H.7.6) referenced in 4-62 repo files each but absent from SKILL.md ledger** (H.7.0 entry collapses 6 prior phases retrospectively), phase ordering anomalies at lines 275 (H.8.4 wedged), 308-310 (v1.0.0 + H.7.0 + H.4.3 trailer chronologically out of place), `skills/agent-team/role-templates/` directory empty — 3 referenced files (pm.md/senior.md/engineer.md) at SKILL.md:232-234 missing, pattern catalog stale by 7 patterns in SKILL.md (`patterns/README.md` 21 rows; SKILL.md 13 rows; `pattern-status-skill-md-consistency` validator passes because it checks listed-only), frontmatter schema divergence in 16 standalone SKILL.md (11 use `name:`+`description:` Anthropic plugin schema; 5 use H.6.7 forge schema `skill:`+`status:`+`domain:`+`canonical_source:`+`forged_via:`+`related_kb:`+`notes:`), `agent-swarm` vs `agent-team` semantic overlap (both `active`; no deprecation flag), 15 follow-up items for HT.0.9, forbidden-phrase grep gate: 1 match — backtick-wrapped citation of SKILL.md H2 heading (`## Anti-pattern: the 1000-zeros problem`) — Form (a) carve-out per master plan v3.1; documentary discipline intact

H.8.x cleanup arc complete (PRs #117-#121 merged). Soak counter at 0/N from H.8.x runtime track.

## Open questions / blockers

None blocking. HT.0.1 + HT.0.2 + HT.0.3 + HT.0.4 + HT.0.5a + HT.0.5b shipped clean. HT.0.6 (ADR system audit) ready in next session.

Soft items for HT-end retrospective:
1. HT-state.md actually load-bearing? (theo FLAG-8 punt) — HT.0.1-5b dogfood: state file served as resume anchor in all six phase commits (HT.0.2 + HT.0.3 ran continuous post-/compact; HT.0.4 + HT.0.5a both ran post-/compact via "continue"; HT.0.5b ran continuous from HT.0.5a same-session). Consistent evidence for keep across 6 phases.
2. Forbidden-phrase grep false-positive rate? (jade FLAG-3 + ari NEW-1) — HT.0.1: 2 matches, both legitimate (rephrased). HT.0.2: 2, both legitimate. HT.0.3: 5, all rephrased. **HT.0.4: 0 matches on first pass — first clean.** **HT.0.5a: 0 matches on first pass — second consecutive clean.** **HT.0.5b: 1 match — backtick-wrapped Form-(a) carve-out citing SKILL.md H2 heading; documentary discipline intact.** 6-phase FP rate: 0/10 (the 9 prior + 1 new match are all real critique-language slips OR Form-(a) carve-outs; the audit author has not produced critique-language). HT.0.5b's match is the first legitimate Form-(a) carve-out invocation across the 6 phases — empirical validation of the carve-out provision in master plan v3.1.
3. HT.0.5a → HT.0.5b sequencing 90-120 min? (ari NEW-3) — **CLOSED**. HT.0.5a wallclock ~45-50 min; HT.0.5b ~30-40 min (continuous from 5a, no /compact between). Combined ~75-90 min — within target lower-half. Empirical confirmation that the sequential 5a→5b sequencing fits the documented bound when both run from fresh state.
4. Top-15 cap survives empirical pressure? (theo FLAG-6 / nova FLAG-6 — empirical answer at HT.0.9). HT.0.1: 15. HT.0.2: 15. HT.0.3: 13. HT.0.4: 14. HT.0.5a: 15. HT.0.5b: 15. 6-phase total: 87 follow-up items pre-deduplication. HT.0.5b items extend HT.0.5a patterns (forward-reference gaps + frontmatter shape divergence) and HT.0.4 patterns (doc-staleness for shipped capabilities). HT.0.9 dedup will compress significantly.
5. Decision on running optional chaos-test between HT.1.N completion and HT.2

## HT.0.1 follow-up items (for HT.0.9 synthesis)

15 follow-up questions surfaced in `## Follow-up questions for plan phase` section of the HT.0.1 research artifact. Highlights:

- **Mechanical doc fixes** (3): ADR-0001 `files_affected` list (14→16); `_lib/settings-reader.js:3` references retired `plugin-loaded-check.js`; `verify-plan-gate.js:16,139` "11th forcing instruction" stale (actual is 10 family-wide).
- **Stale config artifact** (1): `hooks/settings-reference.json` missing 3 entries + 1 matcher mismatch vs canonical `hooks.json` — deletion-or-update decision for HT.0.9.
- **DRY refactor candidates** (3): `resolveSelfImproveScript` × 3 copies; `hasH2Heading` × 2 copies; inline lock primitive in `session-end-nudge.js` vs `_lib/lock.js` shared.
- **Speculative-API exports** in 3 of 3 `_lib/` modules: 7 named exports total have 0 external callers.
- **Subprocess density** in `auto-store-enrichment.js`: worst-case 22 sequential `spawnSync` per Stop event.
- **Multi-responsibility hooks** (3): auto-store-enrichment, pre-compact-save, session-reset each bundle distinct responsibilities at one lifecycle entrypoint — articulate-or-split decision for HT.0.9.
- **Regex-compile-per-call**: 5 sites recompiling regex per fire (validate-plan-schema, verify-plan-gate, validate-kb-doc, auto-store-enrichment, prompt-enrich-trigger).
- **ADR-0001 invariant 3 phrasing nit**: `session-end-nudge.js:130,142` uses event names like `state_save_failed` instead of literal `error` — tighten hook or relax ADR wording.

## HT.0.2 follow-up items (for HT.0.9 synthesis)

15 follow-up questions surfaced in `## Follow-up questions for plan phase` section of the HT.0.2 research artifact. Highlights:

- **DRY divergence post-`_lib/frontmatter.js`** (5 inline copies): `pattern-runner.js:41-56`, `swarm/hierarchical-aggregate.js:63-80`, `contract-verifier.js:41-51`, `contracts-validate.js:56-71`. Refactor candidate.
- **DRY divergence post-`_lib/lock.js`** (1 inline + 2 try-fallback): `prompt-pattern-store.js:65-114` own primitive (5000ms timeout, 30000ms stale, openSync 'wx' style); `spawn-recorder.js` + `self-improve-store.js` try-fallback paths.
- **Multi-responsibility files** (3): `agent-identity.js` (1698 LoC, 5 responsibilities); `contract-verifier.js` (628 LoC, 6 responsibilities); `contracts-validate.js` (796 LoC, 8 named validators) — articulate-or-split decisions for HT.0.9.
- **`agent-identity.js` 2.12× envelope** (1698 LoC vs 800 max): bundles registry CRUD + verdict recording + trust-score computation + verification-policy + lifecycle (prune/unretire/breed). Special-focus item.
- **Inline data density** (master plan special focus): `architecture-relevance-detector.js` 290 of 538 LoC is `ROUTING_RULES` array; `route-decide.js` ~100 LoC is `KEYWORDS` dict + `SUBSTRATE_META_TOKENS`. Externalize-to-JSON decision for HT.0.9.
- **`agent-identity.js` top docstring stale**: lists 5 of 12 subcommands (predates H.6.6/H.7.0). Mechanical-fix.
- **Per-call regex compilation in `route-decide.js`**: ~90 compiles per `scoreTask` invocation via `buildKeywordRegex` recompilation. Pre-compiled cache opportunity.
- **`adr.js` per-call full-tree read**: ~400 file reads per session via `validate-adr-drift.js` Edits. Cache opportunity.
- **`contracts-validate.js` 4× pattern-file reads**: when running 4 pattern-status validators in same invocation. Cache opportunity.
- **State-file env-override missing** (3 scripts): `scripts/self-improve-store.js`, `scripts/prompt-pattern-store.js`, `scripts/quality-factors-backfill.js` (SPAWN_HISTORY field) lack `HETS_X_PATH` overrides while peer scripts (`agent-identity`, `pattern-recorder`, `spawn-recorder`) follow the convention.
- **`swarm/aggregate.js` + `swarm/hierarchical-aggregate.js` use `__dirname`**: no `findToolkitRoot()` adoption; no env override for `run-state/` location. Refactor candidate.
- **6 scripts with `module.exports` and no in-scope external callers**: `verify-plan-spawn.js`, `adr.js`, `build-spawn-context.js`, `architecture-relevance-detector.js`, plus `agent-identity.js` constants surfaced only via `__test_internals__`. Speculative-API pattern; verify scope-wider at HT.0.3 + HT.0.7.
- **kb-resolver vs adr.js symlink-check parity** (master plan special focus, verified): different shapes (kb-resolver canonicalizes + bounds; adr.js forbids symlinks unconditionally), same intent (defend against symlink-escape). Documentary item.
- **`weight-fit.js` THEORY_WEIGHTS vs `agent-identity.js` WEIGHTS divergence** (file_citations_per_finding 0.10 vs 0.135): intentional per `weight-fit.js` purpose ("compare empirical weights to theory-driven priors"). Documentary item.
- **`prompt-pattern-store.js` Phase-X tag era**: predates H.x convention; last-touched at Phase-G2. Documentary item.

## HT.0.3 follow-up items (for HT.0.9 synthesis)

13 follow-up questions surfaced in `## Follow-up questions for plan phase` section of the HT.0.3 research artifact. Highlights:

- **`commands/build-team.md` 322 LoC bundles 6 responsibilities** (parallel to HT.0.1 hooks finding + HT.0.2 `agent-identity.js` finding): route-decide gate + pre-flight + spawn-context auto-extension + tech-stack-analyzer + per-identity verification (3 trust-tier branches) + capability-request handling. Articulate-or-split decision for HT.0.9.
- **Path-reference convention inconsistency** (5 distinct conventions across 13 files): repo-relative, hardcoded author-machine, `$HOME`-aware, relative-path (`../`), deployed-marketplace. `chaos-test.md` mixes hardcoded author-machine + deployed-marketplace in same file. Consolidation candidate.
- **7 commands lack explicit When-to-use sections**: `security-audit.md`, `review.md`, `prune.md`, `evolve.md`, `forge.md`, `self-improve.md`, `chaos-test.md`. Predate H.7.x convention.
- **4 commands lack What-this-is-NOT sections**: same predates-H.7.x cohort. Mechanical-fix.
- **7 commands carry no phase tags**: same cohort. Documentary observation; matches HT.0.2's `prompt-pattern-store.js` Phase-X-tag era pattern.
- **`commands/self-improve.md` predates H.4.1 auto-loop**: command doc describes only the explicit triage workflow; no forward-link to H.4.1 hook-based auto-loop. Mechanical-fix candidate.
- **`commands/forge.md` + `evolve.md` document hardcoded author-machine paths** for both-locations-write pattern: `~/Documents/claude-toolkit/...`. Substrate scripts use `findToolkitRoot()` for runtime resolution; docs use author-path as readable convention. Documentary observation.
- **Command token cost spread**: 33.3× between smallest (`security-audit` ~150 tokens) and largest (`build-team` ~5000 tokens). `build-team.md` is ~45% embedded bash. Externalize-or-collapse decision for HT.0.9 (parallel to HT.0.2's inline-data observations).
- **`commands/research.md:54-56` references documentary personas 14/15/16**: cross-reference for HT.0.4 inventory (the persona MD asymmetry per architect FLAG-2).
- **`commands/chaos-test.md:80` uses `~/.claude/scripts/compliance-probe.sh`** while same file uses `~/Documents/claude-toolkit/scripts/agent-team/...` at lines 18, 21, 24. Two-path convention in same file. Consolidation candidate.
- **`commands/security-audit.md` and `review.md` are minimal (11-12 LoC)**: thin-delegate pattern. Documentary observation.
- **Command cross-reference patterns vary**: H.7.x and H.8.x era commands use relative paths (`../skills/X/SKILL.md`); older commands use repo-relative or external references. Documentary observation.
- **Build-team Step 1.5 H.8.5 wiring + research/implement H.8.6 RPI consistency both verified intact** (master plan special focus). Documentary item.

## HT.0.5b follow-up items (for HT.0.9 synthesis)

15 follow-up questions surfaced in `## Follow-up questions for plan phase` section of the HT.0.5b research artifact. Highlights:

- **Phase ledger 41-vs-61 + ordering anomalies (E.1 + E.3)**: master plan claim "41-phase ledger" stale by 20 entries. Lines 275 (H.8.4 wedged), 308-310 (v1.0.0 + H.7.0 + H.4.3 trailer) chronologically out of place. Re-sort vs accept-current-state vs convert-to-fully-chronological-vs-reverse-chronological — multi-option decision for HT.0.9.
- **~14 phases referenced but absent from SKILL.md ledger (E.2)**: H.5.1-H.5.5 (4-12 file refs each), H.6.0-H.6.8 (6-15 refs each — includes H.6.7 with 15 refs from `forged_via:` frontmatter), H.7.1-H.7.6 (5-62 refs each). H.7.0 entry collapses 6 prior phases retrospectively. Author missing entries vs accept-as-collapsed-into-summary-entries decision.
- **`role-templates/` empty + 3 referenced files missing (A.1 + B.3 + E.4)**: SKILL.md asserts pm/senior/engineer templates; filesystem has empty directory. Author 3 templates vs remove references vs delete directory — 3-option decision.
- **Pattern catalog stale by 7 patterns in SKILL.md (B.1)**: `pattern-status-skill-md-consistency` validator passes because it checks listed-only; 7 patterns present in `patterns/README.md` (15-21) absent from SKILL.md catalog. Validator extension vs SKILL.md catalog update — decision.
- **Skill frontmatter schema divergence (B.2)**: 11 packages use `name:`+`description:` Anthropic plugin schema; 5 use H.6.7 forge schema (`skill:`+`status:`+`domain:`+`canonical_source:`+`forged_via:`+`related_kb:`+`notes:`). Substrate validator passes both. Normalize vs document-both vs accept-as-design — decision.
- **`agent-swarm` vs `agent-team` semantic overlap (A.2 + E.7)**: both `active`; no deprecation flag. Retire `agent-swarm` vs codify-as-proto-HETS vs document relationship — decision.
- **SKILL.md no tier-aware loading (D.1)**: 30K-token whole-file load is the only access pattern; H.8.0 tier-aware loading applies only to `kb/architecture/`. Adopt tier structure for SKILL.md vs accept whole-file load — decision.
- **`Files in this skill` section omits `USING.md` (B.3)**: USING.md (283 LoC) present but not listed in SKILL.md enumeration. Mechanical-fix candidate.
- **`H.2-bridge` era H2 sections describe pre-H.7.0 state (E.5)**: SKILL.md `## Persona-skills mapping (Phase H.2-bridge)` and `## Agent identity & reputation (Phase H.2-bridge)` describe H.2-bridge state; H.7.0 entry documents extensive enhancements not reflected in these sections. Update vs accept-as-historical — decision.
- **`SKILL.md:202` "callsite wired H.7.1" claim cites missing ledger entry (E.6)**: pattern catalog uses H.7.1 phase reference for callsite wiring; H.7.1 has no ledger entry. Update reference vs author H.7.1 entry — decision.
- **H.6.7 phase tag heavily referenced (15 files) but no ledger entry (E.2)**: `forged_via: H.6.7-canonical-source-registry*` in 5 standalone SKILL.md frontmatter; H.6.7 also referenced in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `swarm/H.6.1-resume-findings.md`, `swarm/H.6.9-orchestration-cycle-findings.md`. Author H.6.7 entry vs accept-as-known-gap — decision.
- **Self-improve skill body post-H.4.1 vs `/self-improve` command pre-H.4.1 (E.8)**: pair represents two-half documentation. Cross-reference HT.0.3 follow-up: "`commands/self-improve.md` predates H.4.1 auto-loop". Mechanical-fix candidate.
- **`skills/agent-team/BACKLOG.md` 2572 LoC observation (C.2)**: 3.2× the 800 LoC envelope. Out of scope per master plan; documentary observation that may surface as HT.0.7 (tests + CI) candidate or HT.2 (final docs sweep) item.
- **5 H.6.7-forged Schema-B SKILL.md files use `notes:` field for free-form discipline (B.2)**: airflow, kubernetes, node-backend-development, penetration-testing, react carry multi-line `notes:` field with version pinning + canonical-source operational discipline. Schema-A files don't have an equivalent field. Documentary observation.
- **`SKILL.md:190` Asymmetric Challenger status text "(shipped H.2.3; callsite wired H.7.1)"**: H.7.1 reference points at a phase absent from the ledger (E.2). The `pattern-status-skill-md-consistency` validator reports 0 violations because it checks the `status:` enum value, not the parenthetical phase-tag history. Validator scope clarification + ledger gap together.

## HT.0.5a follow-up items (for HT.0.9 synthesis)

15 follow-up questions surfaced in `## Follow-up questions for plan phase` section of the HT.0.5a research artifact. Highlights:

- **Architecture KB forward-reference resolution policy** (E.1, most weighty): 8 distinct non-existent `kb_id` targets (`agent-design`, `evaluation-under-nondeterminism`, `inference-cost-management`, `information-hiding`, `stable-dependencies`, `bounded-contexts`, `refactor`, `refusal-patterns`) referenced from 7 of 10 architecture KB docs (11 body refs + 5 frontmatter `related:` array entries). Bidirectional validator skips because targets don't exist. Author-the-missing vs prune-the-broken vs annotate-as-planned decision for HT.0.9.
- **`tier_token_targets:` empirical-measurement gap (D.1)**: `validate-kb-doc.js:145` documents the field as optional. 0/10 architecture KB docs include it. Master plan H.0.5a special focus called for empirical telemetry; not present.
- **`stack-skill-map.md:73` references non-existent `14-python-backend` persona (E.2)**: doc text predates H.8.6 documentary-persona slot allocation; slot 14 is now `14-codebase-locator`. Mechanical-fix candidate.
- **`identity-roster.md` does not list `13-node-backend` roster (E.3)**: HT.0.4 confirmed `13-node-backend` is in `agent-identity.js DEFAULT_ROSTERS`; hets KB doc lags. Mechanical-fix candidate.
- **`patterns/README.md:42-43` "Full doc must include" spec divergence (E.5)**: 7/20 patterns deviate (specialized shapes for catalog / convention-enumeration / evolution-history). Update README spec vs accept divergence vs normalize newer patterns — 3-option decision.
- **`plan-mode-hets-injection.md` frontmatter shape outlier (B.3)**: uses `name:`+`phase:` shape; other 19 use `pattern:`+`intent:`. Substrate validator passes both. Normalize-vs-accept decision.
- **`react-essentials.md` "planned" KB docs (E.4)**: 4 forward-references explicitly annotated "planned"; only `typescript-react-patterns` exists with similar name (different `kb_id`).
- **3 hets KB docs hardcode `~/Documents/claude-toolkit/...` paths (E.6)**: cross-cutting consolidation candidate joining HT.0.3's 5-convention path-reference observation.
- **`validator-conventions.md` Convention F gap (C.2)**: H2 sequence runs A, B, C, D, E, G with no F. Documentary observation.
- **`route-decision.md` + `agent-identity-reputation.md` evolution-history sections (B.4)**: H.7.5/H.7.11/H.4.2/H.6.6/H.7.0 historic sections embedded in pattern docs. Pattern-doc-as-historical-ledger decision.
- **`stack-skill-map.md` marketplace-plugin skill references (E.7)**: `engineering:debug`, `data:sql-queries`, etc. — runtime-resolution behavior depends on installed plugins. Cross-cutting check candidate for HT.0.7 or HT.0.8.
- **Stack-specific + hets KB Tier 1 single-paragraph vs 5-bullet shape** (Bar B contrast): per `kb/README.md:25-31` template `## Summary (≤5 lines, distilled)`. Stack-specific docs use single dense paragraph rather than bulleted format. The H.8.0 5-bullet rule applies to architecture KB only.
- **Pattern doc `## Phase` sections in 4 of 7 newer patterns**: `system-design-principles.md:159`, `validator-conventions.md:380`, `forcing-instruction-family.md:106`, `research-plan-implement.md:116` carry explicit `## Phase` body sections. Aligns with evolution-history concern.
- **`canonical-skill-sources.md` LoC outlier in hets KB family (302 LoC vs avg 138)**: 2.2× the family average. Documentary observation; not against 800 LoC envelope.
- **`kb/manifest.json` staleness signal (D.3)**: last-updated 2026-05-07 (3 days stale). Run `kb-resolver scan` and diff candidate for HT.0.9 or HT.2 substrate-state hygiene.

## HT.0.4 follow-up items (for HT.0.9 synthesis)

14 follow-up questions surfaced in `## Follow-up questions for plan phase` section of the HT.0.4 research artifact. Highlights:

- **`noCritiqueLanguage` antiPatternCheck unimplemented**: `scripts/agent-team/contract-verifier.js:376-448` antiPatternChecks block lacks the check; all 3 documentary contracts (14/15/16) reference it. H.3.6 dispatch path produces `unknown_check` warn → all documentary actor outputs verdict at `partial`. Implement-vs-codify-as-ADR decision for HT.0.9.
- **`noDuplicateFindingIds` antiPatternCheck implemented but unreferenced**: `contract-verifier.js:439-447` defines the function; zero contract references. Dead-code-removal vs add-to-contracts decision for HT.0.9.
- **Master plan contract count off-by-one**: master plan v3.1 lines 56 + 273 claim "19 contracts"; filesystem evidences 18. Master-plan mechanical fix.
- **Documentary persona MD asymmetry (architect FLAG-2 explicit decision)**: 14/15/16 contracts present; persona MDs absent. Options (a) author MDs, (b) document why no MDs, (c) hybrid stubs — HT.0.9 selects.
- **Documentary persona roster registration absence**: 14/15/16 not in `agent-identity.js:30-46` DEFAULT_ROSTERS; contracts have fixed `persona` field (vs challenger/engineering-task `<set-at-spawn>` shape). Register-rosters vs add-`<set-at-spawn>`-shape vs accept-as-design decision for HT.0.9.
- **`05-honesty-auditor.md:19` literal session-specific transcript path**: embeds an absolute path with a particular `75cc079e-...` session ID. Mechanical-fix candidate (replace with placeholder).
- **`01-hacker.md` + `03-code-reviewer.md` stale path**: both reference `~/Documents/claude-toolkit/hooks/scripts/prompt-pattern-store.js`; actual file at `scripts/prompt-pattern-store.js`. Mechanical-fix.
- **Builder persona MD template divergence**: 6 abbreviated (07-12, 35-37 LoC) + 7 full (01-06, 13, 88-155 LoC). Normalize-vs-accept decision for HT.0.9.
- **04-architect.md H.6.5 convention as cross-layer claim**: documented at persona MD + commands + scripts + pattern-doc levels; integration verified intact. Documentary observation.
- **Pre-H-phase-tag persona cohort**: 01, 02, 03, 05 predate H.x phase numbering (May 1 last-modified). Cross-phase pattern with HT.0.2 + HT.0.3 same-era findings.
- **`02-confused-user.md` mixed path conventions in same file**: line 13 hardcoded author-machine; line 40 deployed-marketplace. Cross-cutting consolidation candidate.
- **Frontmatter field-requirement asymmetry across persona classes**: auditor + documentary require 5 fields; builder + challenger + engineering-task require 6 (add `identity`). Aligns with roster-registration finding.
- **5 contracts use `_doc` / `_documentary_note` underscore-prefix metadata**: not consumed by `contract-verifier.js`; serve as inline documentation. Documentary observation.
- **Per-call regex compilation in contract-verifier checks** (4 sites): `hasSeveritySections:224`, `noEmptyChallengeSection:300`, `noTemplateRepetition:392`, `claimsHaveEvidence:409`. Same shape as HT.0.1 hook-layer pattern; cost amortization differs (verifier fires once-per-actor vs hook fires per-stdin-event). Documentary observation.

## Next concrete step

**Begin HT.0.6 — ADR system audit.** Per master plan v3.1 methodology (HT.0.6 scope at lines 336-349):

1. New session (if /compact): read `swarm/thoughts/shared/HT-state.md` (this file) — confirm HT.0.1-5b shipped status
2. Read `swarm/thoughts/shared/plans/2026-05-09-HT.0-hardening-track-master-plan.md` — full master plan in context (HT.0.6 scope at lines 336-349)
3. Optional: skim HT.0.1 research artifact for ADR-0001 invariant findings (HT.0.1 captured 4 doc-staleness items; `files_affected` list claim 14 — verify post-H.8.x)
4. Inventory the files in scope:
   - `swarm/adrs/*.md` (currently 1 ADR + `_TEMPLATE.md` + `_README.md`)
   - Cross-reference points: `hooks/scripts/validators/validate-adr-drift.js`, `scripts/agent-team/adr.js`
5. Apply 5 quality bars (same methodology as HT.0.1-5b)
6. Special focus per master plan: ADR-0001's 4 invariants verified across all 14 hooks (chaos quinn F2 found 2/14 violations; verify post-H.8.x); ADR-0001 retroactive shape (chaos theo F4 — should be reshaped as `status: seed` and forward-looking ADR-0002 created — refactor candidate; document state); `files_affected` list accuracy (did any new hooks ship without ADR-0001 update? HT.0.1 found list says 14 → suspect 16 since H.8.x added validators); Touched-by lookups work for all 14 hooks (post-H.8.7 path-segment-aware fix should resolve any false positives/negatives)
7. Author research artifact at `swarm/thoughts/shared/research/2026-05-XX-HT.0.6-adr-system-audit.md`
8. Run forbidden-phrase grep gate before marking phase `[x]`
9. Update HT-state.md cutover routine before session ends; chain HT.0.7 methodology entry pointing at tests + CI

**Resume tip from HT.0.5b dogfood**: HT.0.5b used mechanical extraction (`awk`/`grep` for frontmatter + outline; `grep -rln` for cross-phase reference counts) plus targeted chunked Reads for the dense SKILL.md (offset+limit for 30K-token file). HT.0.6 surface is small (1 ADR + 2 templates ≈ 3 files plus the validator + CLI cross-references); single-pass full-Read methodology likely suffices.

**Cumulative wallclock for HT.0.5a + HT.0.5b combined** (ari NEW-3 target 90-120 min): HT.0.5a ~45-50 min; HT.0.5b ~30-40 min (continuous from 5a, no /compact between). Combined ~75-90 min — within target lower-half. Empirical confirmation that the sequential 5a→5b sequencing fits the documented bound when both run from fresh state.

**/compact recommendation before HT.0.6**: this session crossed the FIC ceiling running HT.0.5a + HT.0.5b sequentially without /compact between (~80-85% utilization expected post-cutover). HT.0.6 surface is small but the FIC discipline holds. **/compact recommendation** before starting HT.0.6 to give the audit a fresh budget and replicate the empirically-favorable HT.0.4-5a-5b fresh-clean pattern.

**Cumulative token cost expected for HT.0.6**: ~25-35% utilization at start if /compact between; ~50-60% at end if 1 ADR + 2 templates + validator + CLI cross-references inspect cleanly. Smallest planned audit phase by file count.

## Drift-notes captured this run

HT.0.1 surfaced no NEW drift-notes (the 15 follow-up items are all already-known forms — DRY duplicates, doc staleness, multi-responsibility bundling at lifecycle entrypoints, speculative-API exports). All 15 land at HT.0.9 synthesis for categorization (ADR-update / mechanical-fix / refactor-candidate / accept-and-document).

**Pattern-level observation from HT.0.1**: 4 of 4 documentation drift findings (ADR-0001 stale list, settings-reference.json stale, _lib/settings-reader.js comment stale, verify-plan-gate.js comment stale) are doc-side staleness — code shipped but downstream docs/comments did not update. Suggests an HT.2-or-earlier mechanical pass for all "stated source vs current actual" reconciliation. Captured here for HT.0.9 / HT.2 input.

HT.0.2 surfaced no NEW drift-notes — the 15 follow-up items extend the same already-known forms identified in HT.0.1 (DRY divergence, multi-responsibility bundling, speculative-API exports, doc staleness, inline-data sizing). All 15 land at HT.0.9 synthesis.

**Pattern-level observation from HT.0.2**: The DRY divergence pattern is the dominant cross-cutting theme. `_lib/frontmatter.js` (H.8.7) has 5 inline copies post-extraction; `_lib/lock.js` (H.3.2) has 1 inline + 2 try-fallback consumers. Each `_lib/` extraction reduces but does not eliminate divergence — adoption is partial across the substrate-scripts family. Cross-cutting refactor candidate at HT.0.9: a single audit-and-mechanical-replace pass for each extracted helper (`parseFrontmatter`, `withLock`, `findToolkitRoot`).

**Pattern-level observation from HT.0.2 (subprocess invocation surface)**: clean. The H.8.4 fix (`_lib/safe-exec.js`) eliminated all string-build `execSync` paths; remaining subprocess sites use array-form `spawn`/`spawnSync`/`execFileSync` (safe-by-construction). No new safety findings.

HT.0.3 surfaced no NEW drift-notes — the 13 follow-up items extend the same already-known forms identified in HT.0.1 + HT.0.2 (multi-responsibility bundling, inline-data sizing, doc staleness, Phase-X-tag era predating H.x). All 13 land at HT.0.9 synthesis.

**Pattern-level observation from HT.0.3 (path-reference convention)**: 5 distinct path conventions in use across `commands/*.md` — repo-relative, hardcoded author-machine, `$HOME`-aware, relative-path (`../`), deployed-marketplace. `chaos-test.md` mixes two of them in the same file. The substrate scripts (HT.0.2) use `findToolkitRoot()` for runtime resolution; the command docs use a mix of conventions for human-readable references. Cross-cutting consolidation candidate at HT.0.9.

**Pattern-level observation from HT.0.3 (no broken refs)**: All script/agent/skill references resolve. The H.8.4 + H.8.5 wiring (build-spawn-context, build-team Step 1.5) is intact. The H.8.6 RPI workflow (research → plan → implement) is consistent end-to-end. The substrate is internally well-linked despite the convention diversity above.

HT.0.4 surfaced no NEW drift-notes — the 14 follow-up items extend the same already-known forms identified in HT.0.1 + HT.0.2 + HT.0.3 (claim-vs-implementation gaps, dead-code candidates, doc staleness, path-convention divergence, pre-H-phase-tag era, frontmatter-shape divergence). All 14 land at HT.0.9 synthesis.

**Pattern-level observation from HT.0.4 (claim-vs-implementation gap, severe form)**: `noCritiqueLanguage` antiPatternCheck is referenced by all 3 documentary contracts (14/15/16) at `swarm/personas-contracts/14-codebase-locator.contract.json:35` etc., but the implementation is absent from `scripts/agent-team/contract-verifier.js:376-448`. The H.3.6 `unknown_check` dispatch path (added precisely to prevent silent passes) instead surfaces the gap as `antiPatternWarns` increment, locking every documentary actor verdict at `partial`. The H.3.6 fix is working as designed; the gap is upstream — the contract claim has no runtime enforcement. HT.0.9 implement-vs-codify-as-ADR decision.

**Pattern-level observation from HT.0.4 (documentary persona class incomplete)**: The 14/15/16 documentary persona class diverges from both the auditor class (no roster registration; persona MDs absent) AND the shared class (challenger/engineering-task use `<set-at-spawn>` persona; documentary uses fixed persona with no roster). The class shape is consistent within the 3 documentary contracts but differs from peer classes in 3 dimensions: (1) no roster, (2) no persona MD, (3) unimplemented antiPattern check. HT.0.9 categorization either resolves this as a 4th-class shape (codify) or as 3 separate gaps to close.

**Cross-phase observation (HT.0.1 + HT.0.2 + HT.0.3 + HT.0.4)**: The multi-responsibility pattern continues for the first 3 phases (3 hooks → 3 scripts → 1 command) but **does not repeat in HT.0.4** — contracts are uniformly small (36-57 LoC each), and the largest persona MD (04-architect at 155 LoC) bundles convention consistent with the architect's role rather than entry-point accretion. The pattern is "lifecycle-entry-point-accretion," not "always-largest-file-bundles-multi-responsibility." HT.0.4 shows the inverse: persona MDs partition cleanly along the auditor/builder/documentary class axis.

**Cross-phase observation (claim-vs-implementation gaps, escalating)**: HT.0.1 found 4 gaps (all doc-side staleness — comments, ADR-0001 list, settings-reference); HT.0.4 finds 2 gaps with semantic weight (master-plan count off-by-one is mechanical; `noCritiqueLanguage` unimplemented locks documentary verdicts at `partial`). The pattern shows variance — most gaps are mechanical doc-staleness; one (HT.0.4 E.2) is structural and impacts runtime verdict.

HT.0.5a surfaced no NEW drift-notes — the 15 follow-up items extend the same already-known forms identified in HT.0.1-4 (forward-reference gaps, doc-staleness post-shipped-feature, frontmatter-shape divergence, hardcoded author-machine paths, evolution-history-sections-in-pattern-docs). All 15 land at HT.0.9 synthesis.

**Pattern-level observation from HT.0.5a (forward-reference gap, structural)**: 7 of 10 architecture KB docs reference 8 distinct `kb_id` targets that have not been authored — `architecture/ai-systems/{agent-design, evaluation-under-nondeterminism, inference-cost-management}`, `architecture/crosscut/{information-hiding, stable-dependencies, bounded-contexts}`, `architecture/discipline/{refactor, refusal-patterns}`. Refs appear in both frontmatter `related:` arrays (5 entries) and body `## Related Patterns` sections (11 markdown links). The bidirectional `related:` validator skips refs to non-existent targets. The pattern is consistent with author intent — 6 of 10 architecture KB docs note "First-wave priority N of the authoring queue" in their `## Phase` body section, indicating a planned-but-deferred sister-doc cohort. HT.0.9 author-the-missing vs prune-the-broken vs annotate-as-planned decision.

**Pattern-level observation from HT.0.5a (path-convention divergence, continuation)**: HT.0.3 found 5 distinct path conventions across `commands/*.md`. HT.0.5a finds 3 of 6 hets KB docs (`spawn-conventions.md`, `challenger-conventions.md`, `symmetric-pair-conventions.md`) hardcode `~/Documents/claude-toolkit/...` author-machine paths in code-block examples. The substrate scripts (HT.0.2-audited) use `findToolkitRoot()` for runtime resolution; the docs use hardcoded paths as readable convention. Cross-cutting consolidation candidate at HT.0.9.

**Pattern-level observation from HT.0.5a (mechanical doc-staleness for shipped capabilities)**: `stack-skill-map.md:73` references future `14-python-backend` persona that conflicts with H.8.6's documentary `14-codebase-locator` slot allocation; `identity-roster.md` does not list `13-node-backend` roster despite the persona shipping in DEFAULT_ROSTERS (HT.0.4 confirmed). Pattern matches HT.0.1's ADR-0001 stale `files_affected` list and HT.0.4's literal session-id path in `05-honesty-auditor.md` — code shipped, downstream docs lagged.

**Cross-phase observation (HT.0.1 + HT.0.2 + HT.0.3 + HT.0.4 + HT.0.5a, forbidden-phrase grep gate empirical pattern)**: HT.0.1 = 2 matches, HT.0.2 = 2 matches, HT.0.3 = 5 matches, HT.0.4 = 0 matches (clean first pass), HT.0.5a = 0 matches (clean first pass). Two consecutive clean-first-pass phases suggest documentary discipline is now internalized at the authoring stage rather than relying on the gate stage. Forbidden-phrase FP rate after 5 phases: 0/9 (all 9 prior matches were real critique-language slips warranting rephrasing).

## Cumulative token cost so far

(Tracked at end of each session for empirical context-discipline data; informs whether the FIC 40-60% target is realistic given HT phase shape.)

- Session of 2026-05-09 (master plan authoring + state-file authoring): ~70% utilization at end
- Session of 2026-05-09 continued (parallel pre-approval verification on master plan + state-file update): ~75-80% utilization at end.
- Session of 2026-05-09 final (v3 absorption + second-pass parallel verification + v3.1 mechanical fixes + approval): ~85-90% utilization at end. **Two pre-approval rounds (4 spawns total) shipped without compacting between them.** Real-world FIC test summary: meta-session shape (plan-authoring + spawn-coordination + revision-authoring) genuinely cannot stay under 60% in current discipline. Architect FLAG-12 carve-out validated with real data.
- Session of 2026-05-09 post-/compact (HT.0.1 hooks layer audit): ~50-55% utilization at end. Started fresh post-/compact; read HT-state.md + master plan section + research README + 22 hook-layer files; ran 5-bar walkthrough; authored ~600-line research artifact; passed forbidden-phrase grep gate (2 matches, both legitimately rephrased to documentary form). Stayed under 60% FIC ceiling for an audit-shape phase. **First empirical data point that an audit phase fits a single session without /compact when started clean.**
- Session of 2026-05-09 post-/compact (HT.0.2 substrate scripts audit): ~65-70% utilization at end. Started fresh post-/compact; read HT-state.md (cached from prior session) + master plan section + 27 files (9839 LoC; 2.81× HT.0.1 surface) in 5 parallel batches; ran 5-bar walkthrough; authored ~430-line research artifact; passed forbidden-phrase grep gate (2 matches, both legitimately rephrased — one paraphrased a master-plan quote, one swapped "must be" for "is found as"). Crossed 60% ceiling near artifact-authoring; landed at ~70% post-cutover. **Empirical data point: audit phases at 2.5-3× the HT.0.1 LoC surface land at 65-70% (above the 60% FIC ceiling). HT.0.3 is smaller (~12 markdown files vs 27 JS files); expect return to HT.0.1 envelope. The 60% target holds for typical audit shapes; large-LoC audit phases overshoot by ~10%.**
- Session of 2026-05-09 continued (HT.0.3 slash commands audit, no /compact between HT.0.2 and HT.0.3): ~75-80% utilization at end. Continued from HT.0.2 ship state at ~70%; read 13 command files (1089 LoC; 11% of HT.0.2 surface) in single parallel-13 batch; ran 5-bar walkthrough; authored ~340-line research artifact; passed forbidden-phrase grep gate (5 matches, all legitimately rephrased: 4 used "broken" from literal master-plan bullet wording, 1 used "need to" inside a literal rule-file quote). Pre-cutover HT.0.3 was at ~75%; post-cutover ~80%. **Empirical data point: running TWO consecutive audit phases without /compact between them (HT.0.2 9839 LoC + HT.0.3 1089 LoC) lands at ~75-80% — above 60% ceiling but under context wall. The HT.0.3 small-surface advantage was partially absorbed by the carry-over from HT.0.2. Recommended discipline: /compact between consecutive audit phases when the prior phase exceeded 2× HT.0.1 surface. HT.0.4's larger expected surface (~33 files: 19 contracts + 13 personas + super-agent.md) suggests /compact before HT.0.4 starts.**
- Session of 2026-05-10 post-/compact (HT.0.4 personas + contracts audit): ~70-75% utilization at end. Started fresh post-/compact; read HT-state.md + master plan section + 33 files (2044 LoC: 18 contracts + 13 persona MDs + super-agent.md + 200-line agent-identity.js section + 175-line contract-verifier section) in 2 parallel batches (19 + 13); ran 5-bar walkthrough; authored ~315-line research artifact; passed forbidden-phrase grep gate **clean on first pass** (0 matches, no rephrasing needed — first HT phase to do so). Empirical FP rate after 4 phases: 0/9 (HT.0.4 contributes 0 to numerator). **Empirical data point: post-/compact-fresh audit phase at 21% of HT.0.2 surface (2044 vs 9839 LoC) but with deeper conceptual analysis (cross-class shape divergence, claim-vs-implementation gap with severity weight) lands at ~70-75% — between HT.0.1 fresh-clean (~50-55%) and HT.0.2 fresh-clean (~65-70%). The 60% target holds for small audit phases (HT.0.1, HT.0.3-fresh); larger or deeper-analysis phases overshoot by 10-15%. /compact before HT.0.4 was the right call empirically.** Master plan special-focus item E.2 (`noCritiqueLanguage` claim-vs-implementation) is the most semantically weighty gap surfaced across 4 phases.
- Session of 2026-05-10 post-/compact (HT.0.5a KB + pattern docs audit): ~70-75% utilization at end. Started fresh post-/compact; read HT-state.md + master plan section; used mechanical extraction (`awk`/`grep`) for frontmatter + H2 structure across all 54 files (8984 LoC) instead of full Read calls; ran `node scripts/agent-team/contracts-validate.js` for substrate-validator confirmation (0 violations on `pattern-related-bidirectional`, `pattern-status-readme-consistency`, `pattern-status-skill-md-consistency`, `contract-kb-scope-resolves`, `pattern-status-frontmatter`); targeted Read calls applied to 8 representative docs (single-responsibility, spawn-conventions, plan-mode-hets-injection, react-essentials, identity-roster, stack-skill-map, plus 7 pattern docs for H2 inventory) for the remaining 20% deeper inspection; authored ~365-line research artifact; passed forbidden-phrase grep gate **clean on first pass** (0 matches — second consecutive HT phase). Empirical FP rate after 5 phases: 0/9 (HT.0.4 + HT.0.5a both contribute 0). **Empirical data point: largest planned audit phase by file count (54 files; 91% of HT.0.2 LoC surface) handled efficiently via mechanical-extraction-first methodology — landed at same ~70-75% utilization as HT.0.4 (33 files; 21% of HT.0.2 LoC surface). The methodology shift (mechanical-first → targeted-Read-second) absorbed the file-count growth without proportional context cost. /compact before HT.0.5a was the right call.** Most weighty finding: 11 broken forward references in 7 of 10 architecture KB docs to 8 non-existent `kb_id` targets — bidirectional validator skips because targets don't exist; surfaces as documented gap not caught by substrate.
- Session of 2026-05-10 continued (HT.0.5b SKILL.md + standalone skills audit; no /compact between HT.0.5a and HT.0.5b): ~80-85% utilization at end (estimate; running into the FIC ceiling). Started from HT.0.5a ship state at ~70-75%; inventoried 17 SKILL.md files (2087 LoC); SKILL.md (333 LoC; 165 KB; 30K tokens) required offset+limit chunked Read calls (single-Read errored at limit=90 due to 497 chars/line average); used mechanical extraction (`awk`/`grep`) for frontmatter schema + outline + cross-phase reference counts via `grep -rln "H.X.Y" --include="*.md"`; authored ~330-line research artifact; passed forbidden-phrase grep gate **with 1 Form-(a) carve-out match** (line 58: backtick-wrapped citation of SKILL.md H2 heading `## Anti-pattern: the 1000-zeros problem` — legitimate per master plan v3.1 carve-out; documentary discipline intact). Empirical FP rate after 6 phases: 0/10 (HT.0.5b's 1 match is real Form-(a) carve-out, not critique-language slip). **Empirical data point: running TWO consecutive audit phases without /compact (HT.0.5a 8984 LoC + HT.0.5b 2087 LoC) lands at ~80-85% — overshoots 60% FIC ceiling but stays under context wall. Recommended discipline: /compact between HT.0.5b and HT.0.6.** Most weighty finding: 41-vs-61 phase-ledger count mismatch + ~14 phases referenced 4-62 times each in repo files but absent from SKILL.md ledger (H.5.1-H.7.6) + role-templates/ empty + 3 referenced template files missing. Master plan + HT-state.md narrative ("41-phase ledger") was stale; actual ledger is 61 entries with chronological ordering anomalies. ari NEW-3 90-120 min target empirically validated for sequential 5a+5b run (~75-90 min combined).
