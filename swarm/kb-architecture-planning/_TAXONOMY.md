# Target Taxonomy

Target structure for `skills/agent-team/kb/architecture/`. Each leaf is a single pattern doc; each branch is a domain category. Authoring fills slots; status tracks progress.

## Top-level structure

The KB has two organizational axes:

- **Hierarchical** for domain-specific patterns that decompose cleanly (frontend / backend / data)
- **Flat** for cross-cutting principles that apply across domains (`crosscut/`, `discipline/`)

This hybrid avoids the "where does Idempotency live?" duplication problem of pure hierarchy.

## Status legend

- `[empty]` — slot exists but no notes yet
- `[notes]` — notes accumulated in `_NOTES.md`; ready for or in authoring
- `[draft]` — pattern doc exists but incomplete
- `[shipped]` — pattern doc complete and registered in `kb/manifest.json`

## Initial state

All slots `[empty]`. Filling begins with source ingestion (Phase 2).

## Estimated final size

Roughly 35-40 docs across all branches. Slots can be added or removed during convergence detection (Phase 3) based on what sources actually surface.

## Slot rationale

### Why `crosscut/` is flat

Patterns like Idempotency apply to APIs (backend/), message queues (data/messaging/), AND database operations (data/concurrency/). Putting it in one subtree creates duplication or hidden coupling. Flat `crosscut/` lets retrieval pull it once regardless of which domain triggered the lookup.

### Why `discipline/` is flat

Engineering practice (refusal patterns, ADR shape, failure-mode analysis) applies to all coding work, not a specific domain. Flat structure for the same reason as `crosscut/`.

### Why hierarchical for frontend/backend/data

These ARE cleanly domain-decomposable. Schema design has nothing to do with frontend rendering; rest-conventions don't apply to caching strategies. Hierarchical pruning gives bounded retrieval cost when domain is clearly identified.

## Overflow handling

Patterns surfaced during source ingestion that don't fit current taxonomy:

1. Tag as `OVERFLOW` in `_NOTES.md`
2. Capture rationale: why doesn't it fit? what would be needed?
3. After 3+ overflow patterns share a category, propose taxonomy expansion to user
4. Don't expand unilaterally; user signs off on structural changes

## Open questions for the user (resolve before authoring)

Resolved this session:

- ~~`security/` as top-level branch?~~ — DEFER; substrate not authoring security primitives currently. Out of scope for v2.0+ KB.
- ~~`testing/` as top-level branch?~~ — DEFER; charlax test antipatterns absorbed into `discipline/` if needed.
- ~~Should `architecture-styles/` be its own branch?~~ — YES; resolved by Mark Richards source confirming 5 named styles + Hard Parts adding architecture-quantum concept.
- ~~Should `ai-systems/` be its own branch?~~ — YES; substrate-uniquely-relevant; AI Engineering (Huyen) is the canonical source.

Still open (defer until first-wave authoring exposes the answer):

- `crosscut/deep-modules.md` vs separate `crosscut/information-hiding.md` — start as combined doc per Ousterhout's framing; may split if it grows past 1500 LoC.
- `crosscut/idempotency.md` placement — in `crosscut/` since it spans data/api/concurrency rather than living under any one branch.
- `frontend/state-management/` deep enough for two slots? — defer; frontend is low-priority for substrate.

## Status legend update

Status `[notes]` means notes are accumulated in `_NOTES.md`; ready for or in authoring. After this session, ~25 slots have `[notes]` status; first-wave authoring queue prioritizes the highest-consensus subset.

The taxonomy is intentionally provisional; refining via authoring outcomes is expected.
