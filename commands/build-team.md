# /build-team — Spawn a HETS team for a build task

User-facing entry point for the [tech-stack-analyzer](../skills/tech-stack-analyzer/SKILL.md) skill. Translates a high-level task description into a concrete spawn plan with user redirect gates before execution.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` — the task description in natural language.

Examples:
- `/build-team Build me a marketing site with a blog`
- `/build-team Add an iOS companion app to my existing web product`
- `/build-team Refactor the Spring Boot service to use structured concurrency`
- `/build-team Audit the auth flow before we ship the new payments feature`

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask one clarifying question (intent + domain) and stop.

## Steps

### 1. Pre-flight check
Verify the HETS substrate is ready:

```bash
node ~/Documents/claude-toolkit/scripts/agent-team/kb-resolver.js cat hets/stack-skill-map | head -3
node ~/Documents/claude-toolkit/scripts/agent-team/kb-resolver.js scan
node ~/Documents/claude-toolkit/scripts/agent-team/agent-identity.js list | head -3
```

If any of these fail, surface the issue and STOP. Don't try to build a team on broken substrate.

### 2. Invoke the tech-stack-analyzer skill
Follow the 7-step workflow in `skills/tech-stack-analyzer/SKILL.md`:
- Step 1: Parse user intent (extract `intent` + `domain` + `constraints`)
- Step 2: Look up matching stack from `kb:hets/stack-skill-map`
- Step 3: Build the plan (stack + skills + personas + team-size estimate)
- Step 4: Cross-check skill availability (mark each as available / marketplace / missing)
- Step 5: **USER GATE 1** — present plan, wait for approve / adjust / cancel
- Step 6: **USER GATE 2** (if missing skills) — bootstrap-via-forge approval
- Step 7: Spawn each identity with tier-appropriate verification

  For each identity in the planned team:

  ```bash
  # 1. Get verification recommendation
  REC=$(node ~/Documents/claude-toolkit/scripts/agent-team/agent-identity.js \
    recommend-verification --identity "$IDENTITY")
  VERIFICATION=$(echo "$REC" | jq -r '.verification')
  CHALLENGER_COUNT=$(echo "$REC" | jq -r '.challengerCount')
  TIER=$(echo "$REC" | jq -r '.tier')

  # 2. Spawn implementer (always, regardless of tier)
  spawn_implementer "$IDENTITY" "$TASK"   # follows kb:hets/spawn-conventions

  # H.5.7 — task-type heuristic for contract selection.
  # Honors --task-type explicit override if root provides ($TASK_TYPE_OVERRIDE);
  # otherwise heuristic-by-verbs. Audit-precedence by design: mixed-mode tasks
  # ("audit and fix the OAuth flow") default to audit unless override forces
  # engineering. Engineering is the fallback default — its 1+1 thresholds make it
  # permissive, so a misclassified-as-engineering audit task still passes (no
  # regression). A misclassified-as-audit engineering task fails the audit
  # contract on minFindings/citations padding — which IS the H.5.7 problem this
  # heuristic exists to solve.
  TASK_TYPE_OVERRIDE=""  # Root sets to "audit" or "engineering" if explicit; else heuristic fires.

  if [ -n "$TASK_TYPE_OVERRIDE" ]; then
    TASK_TYPE="$TASK_TYPE_OVERRIDE"
  elif echo "$TASK_DESCRIPTION" | grep -iE "audit|review|assess|analyze|investigate|check|verify|inspect|examine|find vulnerabilities" > /dev/null; then
    TASK_TYPE="audit"
  else
    TASK_TYPE="engineering"  # fallback default — permissive contract has no regression risk
  fi

  if [ "$TASK_TYPE" = "audit" ]; then
    IMPL_CONTRACT="swarm/personas-contracts/${PERSONA}.contract.json"  # use persona's audit-shaped contract
  else
    IMPL_CONTRACT="swarm/personas-contracts/engineering-task.contract.json"  # H.5.7 generic engineering contract
  fi

  echo "H.5.7 selected: TASK_TYPE=$TASK_TYPE, CONTRACT=$IMPL_CONTRACT"

  # 3. Branch on verification policy.
  #    SKIP_CHECKS is read ONLY in the high-trust branch (H-2 of the H.7.1 design):
  #    medium/low must run full verification.
  case "$VERIFICATION" in
    spot-check-only)
      # high-trust — verify with skipped expensive checks (only branch that
      # consumes recommend-verification.skipChecks; do NOT forward this flag
      # in the medium/low branches).
      SKIP_CHECKS=$(echo "$REC" | jq -r '.skipChecks | join(",")')
      node ~/Documents/claude-toolkit/scripts/agent-team/contract-verifier.js \
        --contract "$IMPL_CONTRACT" \
        --output "$IMPL_OUTPUT" \
        --identity "$IDENTITY" \
        --skip-checks "$SKIP_CHECKS"
      ;;

    asymmetric-challenger)
      # medium-trust — verify implementer first (full checks; SKIP_CHECKS empty)
      node ~/Documents/claude-toolkit/scripts/agent-team/contract-verifier.js \
        --contract "$IMPL_CONTRACT" --output "$IMPL_OUTPUT" --identity "$IDENTITY"

      # then spawn 1 challenger (different persona preferred)
      CHALLENGER=$(node ~/Documents/claude-toolkit/scripts/agent-team/agent-identity.js \
        assign-challenger \
          --exclude-persona "${IDENTITY%%.*}" \
          --exclude-identity "$IDENTITY" \
          --task "challenge-${IDENTITY}" | jq -r '.challenger.identity')
      spawn_challenger "$CHALLENGER" "$IMPL_OUTPUT"   # follows kb:hets/challenger-conventions

      # record paired result with convergence signal
      node ~/Documents/claude-toolkit/scripts/agent-team/pattern-recorder.js record \
        --task-signature "${IDENTITY%%.*}:actor-${IDENTITY%%.*}" \
        --persona "${IDENTITY%%.*}" \
        --identity "$IDENTITY" \
        --verdict "$VERDICT" \
        --paired-with "$CHALLENGER" \
        --convergence "$CONVERGENCE"   # agree|disagree|n/a from challenger output analysis
      ;;

    symmetric-pair)
      # low-trust or unproven — full verification + 2 challengers
      node ~/Documents/claude-toolkit/scripts/agent-team/contract-verifier.js \
        --contract "$IMPL_CONTRACT" --output "$IMPL_OUTPUT" --identity "$IDENTITY"

      # use the new assign-pair subcommand (cleaner than two assign-challenger calls)
      PAIR=$(node ~/Documents/claude-toolkit/scripts/agent-team/agent-identity.js \
        assign-pair \
          --persona "${IDENTITY%%.*}" \
          --count "$CHALLENGER_COUNT" \
          --task "challenge-${IDENTITY}")
      CH1=$(echo "$PAIR" | jq -r '.pair[0]')
      CH2=$(echo "$PAIR" | jq -r '.pair[1]')

      spawn_challenger "$CH1" "$IMPL_OUTPUT"
      spawn_challenger "$CH2" "$IMPL_OUTPUT"

      # record paired with convergence (compare CH1+CH2 outputs)
      node ~/Documents/claude-toolkit/scripts/agent-team/pattern-recorder.js record \
        --task-signature "${IDENTITY%%.*}:actor-${IDENTITY%%.*}" \
        --persona "${IDENTITY%%.*}" \
        --identity "$IDENTITY" \
        --verdict "$VERDICT" \
        --paired-with "${CH1},${CH2}" \
        --convergence "$CONVERGENCE"
      ;;
  esac
  ```

  After all identities have completed Step 7's branch, surface the `convergence_agree_pct` aggregate via:

  ```bash
  node ~/Documents/claude-toolkit/scripts/agent-team/agent-identity.js stats --identity "$IDENTITY" | jq '.aggregate_quality_factors'
  ```

  The chat agent (Claude reading `/build-team`) follows this flow per identity. The `spawn_implementer` and `spawn_challenger` placeholders are conventions documented in `kb:hets/spawn-conventions` and `kb:hets/challenger-conventions`.

### 3. Show user the consolidated artifact

After all spawned actors complete + verification + (per policy) challenger pairs:
- Each persona's `node-actor-{persona}-{identity}.md` in `swarm/run-state/<run-id>/`
- Optional: super-agent synthesis at `node-super-root.md` if team-size ≥3

### 4. Handle capability requests from sub-agents (H.6.5)

After every spawned actor completes, scan its return value for a `request:` block in the `## Notes` section. Sub-agents follow the **missing-capability-signal** convention (see `patterns/missing-capability-signal.md`): they do NOT write substrate files themselves; they emit structured requests for root (you, the orchestrator) to act on.

For each request, surface to the user with the concrete file list, then act per the user's decision:

| Request type | Root acquires by | User-gate question |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| `forge-skill` | Invoke `/forge` skill (existing flow) | "Author skill X via /forge?" |
| `forge-persona` | Direct authoring via Edit/Write — 4 files (persona.md, contract.json, 2 KB docs) + 3 config edits (DEFAULT_ROSTERS in agent-identity.js, live `agent-identities.json`, stack-skill-map) | "Author new persona X with these 4 files + 3 config edits?" |
| `author-kb-doc` | Direct Write of the KB doc + `kb-resolver scan` to register | "Author KB doc kb:X/Y at path Z?" |
| `extend-stack-map` | Edit `kb:hets/stack-skill-map` to add the new stack entry | "Extend stack-skill-map with entry for stack X?" |

Skip a request if the user rejects, but record the rejection in the run notes. **Never silently ignore a request** — that's how capability gaps perpetuate across runs.

### 5. Don't auto-commit

Same convention as `/chaos-test`: this command produces *artifacts* the user can review and act on. It does NOT auto-commit code, push branches, or merge PRs. Spawned personas may write code (e.g., 09-react-frontend implementing a component) but the user explicitly reviews + commits.

Capability requests acquired in step 4 ARE allowed to land as committed file additions on a feature branch (substrate extensions persist; not auto-committed but the user is expected to commit them once the run finishes since they're tracked as toolkit growth).

## What this command is NOT

- Not for one-off questions ("how do I write a regex for X?") — use plain Claude
- Not for chaos-testing the toolkit itself — use `/chaos-test`
- Not a substitute for explicit project planning when stakes are high — use `/plan` first if you want a written plan before spawning the team

## Why a separate command vs always-on heuristic

Same rationale as the prompt-enrichment gate: explicit user invocation makes the trust boundary clear. The user knows they're spawning a team (cost, latency, multiple personas). The skill's two user-gates inside the workflow handle the "did I pick the right stack" question.

## Phase status

`/build-team` is the H.2.5 entry point. As of H.2.5, the skill scaffold + KB + pattern are implemented. The actual `/forge` integration for skill-bootstrapping uses the existing `/forge` command — which authors locally but does NOT yet do internet research. Internet-research gating is documented in [patterns/skill-bootstrapping.md](../skills/agent-team/patterns/skill-bootstrapping.md) and remains a follow-up. For now, missing skills surface to the user; if the user picks "proceed without specialization", the spawn proceeds with promise-mode references intact.
